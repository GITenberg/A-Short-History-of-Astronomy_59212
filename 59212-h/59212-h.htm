<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>I have tried to give in this book an outline of the history
of astronomy from the earliest historical times to the present
day, and to present it in a form which shall be intelligible
to a reader who has no special knowledge of either astronomy
or mathematics, and has only an ordinary educated person’s
power of following scientific reasoning.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish my object within the limits of
one small volume it has been necessary to pay the strictest
attention to compression; this has been effected to some
extent by the omission of all but the scantiest treatment
of several branches of the subject which would figure
prominently in a book written on a different plan or on
a different scale. I have deliberately abstained from giving
any connected account of the astronomy of the Egyptians,
Chaldaeans, Chinese, and others to whom the early development
of astronomy is usually attributed. On the one
hand, it does not appear to me possible to form an independent
opinion on the subject without a first-hand
knowledge of the documents and inscriptions from which
our information is derived; and on the other, the various
Oriental scholars who have this knowledge still differ so
widely from one another in the interpretations that they
give that it appears premature to embody their results in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
the dogmatic form of a textbook. It has also seemed
advisable to lighten the book by omitting—except in a very
few simple and important cases—all accounts of astronomical
instruments; I do not remember ever to have
derived any pleasure or profit from a written description
of a scientific instrument before seeing the instrument
itself, or one very similar to it, and I have abstained
from attempting to give to my readers what I have never
succeeded in obtaining myself. The aim of the book
has also necessitated the omission of a number of important
astronomical discoveries, which find their natural
expression in the technical language of mathematics. I
have on this account only been able to describe in the
briefest and most general way the wonderful and beautiful
superstructure which several generations of mathematicians
have erected on the foundations laid by Newton. For
the same reason I have been compelled occasionally
to occupy a good deal of space in stating in ordinary
English what might have been expressed much more
briefly, as well as more clearly, by an algebraical formula:
for the benefit of such mathematicians as may happen to
read the book I have added a few mathematical footnotes;
otherwise I have tried to abstain scrupulously from the
use of any mathematics beyond simple arithmetic and a
few technical terms which are explained in the text. A
good deal of space has also been saved by the total
omission of, or the briefest possible reference to, a very
large number of astronomical facts which do not bear on
any well-established general theory; and for similar reasons
I have generally abstained from noticing speculative
theories which have not yet been established or refuted.
In particular, for these and for other reasons (stated more
fully at the beginning of chapter <span class="smcap">XIII.</span>), I have dealt in the
briefest possible way with the immense mass of observations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
which modern astronomy has accumulated; it would, for
example, have been easy to have filled one or more volumes
with an account of observations of sun-spots made during
the last half-century, and of theories based on them, but
I have in fact only given a page or two to the subject.</p>

<p>I have given short biographical sketches of leading astronomers
(other than living ones), whenever the material
existed, and have attempted in this way to make their
personalities and surroundings tolerably vivid; but I
have tried to resist the temptation of filling up space
with merely picturesque details having no real bearing on
scientific progress. The trial of Kepler’s mother for witchcraft
is probably quite as interesting as that of Galilei
before the Inquisition, but I have entirely omitted the first
and given a good deal of space to the second, because,
while the former appeared to be chiefly of curious interest,
the latter appeared to me to be not merely a striking incident
in the life of a great astronomer, but a part of the
history of astronomical thought. I have also inserted a
large number of dates, as they occupy very little space, and
may be found useful by some readers, while they can be
ignored with great ease by others; to facilitate reference
the dates of birth and death (when known) of every
astronomer of note mentioned in the book (other than
living ones) have been put into the Index of Names.</p>

<p>I have not scrupled to give a good deal of space to
descriptions of such obsolete theories as appeared to me to
form an integral part of astronomical progress. One of the
reasons why the history of a science is worth studying is
that it sheds light on the processes whereby a scientific
theory is formed in order to account for certain facts,
and then undergoes successive modifications as new facts
are gradually brought to bear on it, and is perhaps
finally abandoned when its discrepancies with facts can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
no longer be explained or concealed. For example, no
modern astronomer as such need be concerned with
the Greek scheme of epicycles, but the history of its
invention, of its gradual perfection as fresh observations
were obtained, of its subsequent failure to stand more
stringent tests, and of its final abandonment in favour of
a more satisfactory theory, is, I think, a valuable and
interesting object-lesson in scientific method. I have at
any rate written this book with that conviction, and have
decided very largely from that point of view what to omit
and what to include.</p>

<p>The book makes no claim to be an original contribution
to the subject; it is written largely from second-hand
sources, of which, however, many are not very accessible to
the general reader. Particulars of the authorities which
have been used are given in an appendix.</p>

<p>It remains gratefully to acknowledge the help that I have
received in my work. Mr. W. W. Rouse Ball, Tutor of
Trinity College, whose great knowledge of the history of
mathematics—a subject very closely connected with astronomy—has
made his criticisms of special value, has been
kind enough to read the proofs, and has thereby saved me
from several errors; he has also given me valuable information
with regard to portraits of astronomers. Miss H.
M. Johnson has undertaken the laborious and tedious task
of reading the whole book in manuscript as well as in
proof, and of verifying the cross-references. Miss F.
Hardcastle, of Girton College, has also read the proofs,
and verified most of the numerical calculations, as well as
the cross-references. To both I am indebted for the
detection of a large number of obscurities in expression,
as well as of clerical and other errors and of misprints.
Miss Johnson has also saved me much time by making the
Index of Names, and Miss Hardcastle has rendered me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
a further service of great value by drawing a considerable
number of the diagrams. I am also indebted to
Mr. C. E. Inglis, of this College, for fig. 81; and I have
to thank Mr. W. H. Wesley, of the Royal Astronomical
Society, for various references to the literature of the
subject, and in particular for help in obtaining access to
various illustrations.</p>

<p>I am further indebted to the following bodies and
individual astronomers for permission to reproduce photographs
and drawings, and in some cases also for the gift
of copies of the originals: the Council of the Royal Society,
the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Director
of the Lick Observatory, the Director of the Instituto
Geographico-Militare of Florence, Professor Barnard,
Major Darwin, Dr. Gill, M. Janssen, M. Loewy, Mr. E.
W. Maunder, Mr. H. Pain, Professor E. C. Pickering,
Dr. Schuster, Dr. Max Wolf.</p>

<p><a id="para_1"></a>1. Astronomy is the science which treats of the sun, the
moon, the stars, and other objects such as comets which are
seen in the sky. It deals to some extent also with the earth,
but only in so far as it has properties in common with the
heavenly bodies. In early times astronomy was concerned
almost entirely with the observed motions of the heavenly
bodies. At a later stage astronomers were able to discover
the distances and sizes of many of the heavenly bodies,
and to weigh some of them; and more recently they have
acquired a considerable amount of knowledge as to their
nature and the material of which they are made.</p>

<p><a id="para_2"></a>2. We know nothing of the beginnings of astronomy,
and can only conjecture how certain of the simpler facts
of the science—particularly those with a direct influence on
human life and comfort—gradually became familiar to early
mankind, very much as they are familiar to modern savages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>With these facts it is convenient to begin, taking them in
the order in which they most readily present themselves to
any ordinary observer.</p>

<p><a id="para_3"></a>3. The sun is daily seen to rise in the eastern part of
the sky, to travel across the sky, to reach its highest position
in the south in the middle of the day, then to sink, and
finally to set in the western part of the sky. But its daily
path across the sky is not always the same: the points of
the horizon at which it rises and sets, its height in the sky
at midday, and the time from sunrise to sunset, all go
through a series of changes, which are accompanied by
changes in the weather, in vegetation, etc.; and we are
thus able to recognise the existence of the seasons, and
their recurrence after a certain interval of time which is
known as a year.</p>

<p><a id="para_4"></a>4. But while the sun always appears as a bright circular
disc, the next most conspicuous of the heavenly bodies, the
moon, undergoes changes of form which readily strike the
observer, and are at once seen to take place in a regular order
and at about the same intervals of time. A little more care,
however, is necessary in order to observe the connection
between the form of the moon and her position in the sky
with respect to the sun. Thus when the moon is first
visible soon after sunset near the place where the sun has set,
her form is a thin crescent (cf. fig. 11 on p. 31), the hollow
side being turned away from the sun, and she sets soon
after the sun. Next night the moon is farther from the
sun, the crescent is thicker, and she sets later; and so on,
until after rather less than a week from the first appearance
of the crescent, she appears as a semicircular disc, with
the flat side turned away from the sun. The semicircle
enlarges, and after another week has grown into a complete
disc; the moon is now nearly in the opposite direction to
the sun, and therefore rises about at sunset and sets about
at sunrise. She then begins to approach the sun on the
other side, rising before it and setting in the daytime;
her size again diminishes, until after another week she is
again semicircular, the flat side being still turned away
from the sun, but being now turned towards the west
instead of towards the east. The semicircle then becomes
a gradually diminishing crescent, and the time of rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
approaches the time of sunrise, until the moon becomes
altogether invisible. After two or three nights the new
moon reappears, and the whole series of changes is repeated.
The different forms thus assumed by the moon are now
known as her <b>phases</b>; the time occupied by this series of
changes, the month, would naturally suggest itself as a convenient
measure of time; and the day, month, and year
would thus form the basis of a rough system of time-measurement.</p>

<p><a id="para_5"></a>5. From a few observations of the stars it could also
clearly be seen that they too, like the sun and moon,
changed their positions in the sky, those towards the east
being seen to rise, and those towards the west to sink and
finally set, while others moved across the sky from east to
west, and those in a certain northern part of the sky, though
also in motion, were never seen either to rise or set. Although
anything like a complete classification of the stars belongs
to a more advanced stage of the subject, a few star groups
could easily be recognised, and their position in the sky
could be used as a rough means of measuring time at night,
just as the position of the sun to indicate the time of day.</p>

<p><a id="para_6"></a>6. To these rudimentary notions important additions
were made when rather more careful and prolonged observations
became possible, and some little thought was
devoted to their interpretation.</p>

<p>Several peoples who reached a high stage of civilisation
at an early period claim to have made important progress
in astronomy. Greek traditions assign considerable astronomical
knowledge to Egyptian priests who lived some
thousands of years <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and some of the peculiarities of
the pyramids which were built at some such period are at
any rate plausibly interpreted as evidence of pretty accurate
astronomical observations; Chinese records describe observations
supposed to have been made in the 25th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>;
some of the Indian sacred books refer to astronomical
knowledge acquired several centuries before this time; and
the first observations of the Chaldaean priests of Babylon
have been attributed to times not much later.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the earliest recorded astronomical
observation the authenticity of which may be accepted
without scruple belongs only to the 8th century <span class="smcap">B.C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></span></p>

<p>For the purposes of this book it is not worth while to
make any attempt to disentangle from the mass of doubtful
tradition and conjectural interpretation of inscriptions, bearing
on this early astronomy, the few facts which lie embedded
therein; and we may proceed at once to give some account
of the astronomical knowledge, other than that already dealt
with, which is discovered in the possession of the earliest
really historical astronomers—the Greeks—at the beginning
of their scientific history, leaving it an open question what
portions of it were derived from Egyptians, Chaldaeans, their
own ancestors, or other sources.</p>

<p><a id="para_7"></a>7. If an observer looks at the stars on any clear night
he sees an apparently innumerable<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> host of them, which
seem to lie on a portion of a spherical surface, of which he
is the centre. This spherical surface is commonly spoken
of as the sky, and is known to astronomy as the <b>celestial
sphere</b>. The visible part of this sphere is bounded by the
earth, so that only half can be seen at once; but only the
slightest effort of the imagination is required to think of
the other half as lying below the earth, and containing other
stars, as well as the sun. This sphere appears to the
observer to be very large, though he is incapable of forming
any precise estimate of its size.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Most of us at the present day have been taught in childhood
that the stars are at different distances, and that this
sphere has in consequence no real existence. The early
peoples had no knowledge of this, and for them the celestial
sphere really existed, and was often thought to be a solid
sphere of crystal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i_p005.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—The celestial sphere.</div>
</div>

<p>Moreover modern astronomers, as well as ancient, find
it convenient for very many purposes to make use of this
sphere, though it has no material existence, as a means
of representing the directions in which the heavenly bodies
are seen and their motions. For all that direct observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
can tell us about the position of such an object as a star
is its <i>direction</i>; its distance can only be ascertained by
indirect methods, if at all. If we draw a sphere, and
suppose the observer’s eye placed at its centre <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> (fig. 1),
and then draw a straight line from <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> to a star <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, meeting
the surface of the sphere in the point <i>s</i>; then the star
appears exactly in the same position as if it were at <i>s</i>,
nor would its apparent position be changed if it were
placed at any other point, such as <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">S″</span>, on this same
line. When we speak, therefore, of a star as being at
a point <i>s</i> on the celestial sphere, all that we mean is that
it is in the same direction as the point <i>s</i>, or, in other
words, that it is situated somewhere on the straight line
through <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>. The advantages of this method of representing
the position of a star become evident when we wish
to compare the positions of several stars. The difference
of direction of two stars is the angle between the lines
drawn from the eye to the stars; <i>e.g.</i>, if the stars are <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, it
is the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">R O S</span>. Similarly the difference of direction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
another pair of stars, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>, is the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">P O Q</span>. The two stars
<span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span> appear nearer together than do <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, or farther
apart, according as the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">P O Q</span> is less or greater than
the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">R O S</span>. But if we represent the stars by the
corresponding points <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i> on the celestial sphere, then
(by an obvious property of the sphere) the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">P O Q</span>
(which is the same as <i>p</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> <i>q</i>) is less or greater than the
angle <span class="smcap lowercase">R O S</span> (or <i>r</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> <i>s</i>) according as the arc joining <i>p q</i>
on the sphere is less or greater than the arc joining <i>r s</i>,
and in the same proportion; if, for example, the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">R O S</span>
is twice as great as the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">P O Q</span>, so also is the arc <i>p q</i>
twice as great as the arc <i>r s</i>. We may therefore, in all
questions relating only to the directions of the stars, replace
the angle between the directions of two stars by the arc
joining the corresponding points on the celestial sphere, or,
in other words, by the distance between these points on
the celestial sphere. But such arcs on a sphere are
easier both to estimate by eye and to treat geometrically
than angles, and the use of the celestial sphere is therefore
of great value, apart from its historical origin. It is important
to note that this <b>apparent distance</b> of two stars,
<i>i.e.</i> their distance from one another on the celestial sphere,
is an entirely different thing from their actual distance from
one another in space. In the figure, for example, <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span> is
actually much nearer to <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> than it is to <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, but the apparent
distance measured by the arc <i>q s</i> is several times greater
than <i>q p</i>. The apparent distance of two points on the
celestial sphere is measured numerically by the angle
between the lines joining the eye to the two points,
expressed in <b>degrees</b>, <b>minutes</b>, and <b>seconds</b>.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>We might of course agree to regard the celestial sphere
as of a particular size, and then express the distance between
two points on it in miles, feet, or inches; but it is
practically very inconvenient to do so. To say, as some
people occasionally do, that the distance between two stars
is so many feet is meaningless, unless the supposed size of
the celestial sphere is given at the same time.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that the observer is
always at the centre of the celestial sphere; this remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
true even if he moves to another place. A sphere has,
however, only one centre, and therefore if the sphere
remains fixed the observer cannot move about and yet
always remain at the centre. The old astronomers met
this difficulty by supposing that the celestial sphere was so
large that any possible motion of the observer would be
insignificant in comparison with the radius of the sphere and
could be neglected. It is often more convenient—when
we are using the sphere as a mere geometrical device for
representing the position of the stars—to regard the sphere
as moving with the observer, so that he always remains at
the centre.</p>

<p><a id="para_8"></a>8. Although the stars all appear to move across the
sky (<a href="#para_5">§&nbsp;5</a>), and their rates of motion differ, yet the distance
between any two stars remains unchanged, and they were
consequently regarded as being attached to the celestial
sphere. Moreover a little careful observation would have
shown that the motions of the stars in different parts of the
sky, though at first sight very different, were just such
as would have been produced by the celestial sphere—with
the stars attached to it—turning about an axis passing
through the centre and through a point in the northern
sky close to the familiar pole-star. This point is called
the <b>pole</b>. As, however, a straight line drawn through the
centre of a sphere meets it in two points, the axis of
the celestial sphere meets it again in a second point,
opposite the first, lying in a part of the celestial sphere
which is permanently below the horizon. This second
point is also called a pole; and if the two poles have to
be distinguished, the one mentioned first is called the
<b>north pole</b>, and the other the <b>south pole</b>. The direction
of the rotation of the celestial sphere about its axis is
such that stars near the north pole are seen to move round
it in circles in the direction opposite to that in which the
hands of a clock move; the motion is uniform, and a
complete revolution is performed in four minutes less than
twenty-four hours; so that the position of any star in the
sky at twelve o’clock to-night is the same as its position at
four minutes to twelve to-morrow night.</p>

<p>The moon, like the stars, shares this motion of the
celestial sphere and so also does the sun, though this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
is more difficult to recognise owing to the fact that the sun
and stars are not seen together.</p>

<p>As other motions of the celestial bodies have to be dealt
with, the general motion just described may be conveniently
referred to as the <b>daily motion</b> or <b>daily rotation</b> of the
celestial sphere.</p>

<p><a id="para_9"></a>9. A further study of the daily motion would lead to the
recognition of certain important circles of the celestial sphere.</p>

<p>Each star describes in its daily motion a circle, the size
of which depends on its distance from the poles. Fig. 2
shews the paths described by a number of stars near the
pole, recorded photographically, during part of a night.
The pole-star describes so small a circle that its motion can
only with difficulty be detected with the naked eye, stars a
little farther off the pole describe larger circles, and so on,
until we come to stars half-way between the two poles, which
describe the largest circle which can be drawn on the
celestial sphere. The circle on which these stars lie and
which is described by any one of them daily is called the
<b>equator</b>. By looking at a diagram such as fig. 3, or, better
still, by looking at an actual globe, it can easily be seen
that half the equator (<span class="smcap lowercase">E Q W</span>) lies above and half (the
dotted part, <span class="smcap lowercase">W R E</span>) below the horizon, and that in consequence
a star, such as <i>s</i>, lying on the equator, is in its daily
motion as long a time above the horizon as below. If
a star, such as <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, lies on the north side of the equator, <i>i.e.</i>
on the side on which the north pole <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> lies, more than half
of its daily path lies above the horizon and less than half
(as shewn by the dotted line) lies below; and if a star
is near enough to the north pole (more precisely, if it is
nearer to the north pole than the nearest point, <span class="smcap lowercase">K</span>, of the
horizon), as σ, it never sets, but remains continually above
the horizon. Such a star is called a (<b>northern</b>) <b>circumpolar</b>
star. On the other hand, less than half of the daily path of
a star on the south side of the equator, as <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>, is above the
horizon, and a star, such as σ′, the distance of which from
the north pole is greater than the distance of the farthest
point, <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>, of the horizon, or which is nearer than <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span> to the
south pole, remains continually below the horizon.</p>

<p><a id="para_10"></a>10. A slight familiarity with the stars is enough to shew
any one that the same stars are not always visible at the
same time of night. Rather more careful observation,
carried out for a considerable time, is necessary in order
to see that the aspect of the sky changes in a regular way
from night to night, and that after the lapse of a year the
same stars become again visible at the same time. The
explanation of these changes as due to the motion of
the sun on the celestial sphere is more difficult, and the
unknown discoverer of this fact certainly made one of
the most important steps in early astronomy.</p>

</div>

<p>If an observer notices soon after sunset a star somewhere
in the west, and looks for it again a few evenings later at
about the same time, he finds it lower down and nearer to
the sun; a few evenings later still it is invisible, while its
place has now been taken by some other star which was at
first farther east in the sky. This star can in turn be
observed to approach the sun evening by evening. Or if
the stars visible after sunset low down in the east are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
noticed a few days later, they are found to be higher up
in the sky, and their place is taken by other stars at
first too low down to be seen. Such observations of
stars rising or setting about sunrise or sunset shewed to
early observers that the stars were gradually changing their
position with respect to the sun, or that the sun was
changing its position with respect to the stars.</p>

<p>The changes just described, coupled with the fact that
the stars do not change their positions with respect to one
another, shew that the stars as a whole perform their daily
revolution rather more rapidly than the sun, and at such a
rate that they gain on it one complete revolution in the
course of the year. This can be expressed otherwise in
the form that the stars are all moving westward on the
celestial sphere, relatively to the sun, so that stars on the
east are continually approaching and those on the west
continually receding from the sun. But, again, the same
facts can be expressed with equal accuracy and greater
simplicity if we regard the stars as fixed on the celestial
sphere, and the sun as moving on it from west to east
among them (that is, in the direction <i>opposite</i> to that of
the daily motion), and at such a rate as to complete a
circuit of the celestial sphere and to return to the same
position after a year.</p>

<p>This <b>annual motion</b> of the sun is, however, readily seen
not to be merely a motion from west to east, for if so the
sun would always rise and set at the same points of the
horizon, as a star does, and its midday height in the sky
and the time from sunrise to sunset would always be the
same. We have already seen that if a star lies on the
equator half of its daily path is above the horizon, if
the star is north of the equator more than half, and if south
of the equator less than half; and what is true of a star is true
for the same reason of any body sharing the daily motion of
the celestial sphere. During the summer months therefore
(March to September), when the day is longer than the night,
and more than half of the sun’s daily path is above the
horizon, the sun must be north of the equator, and during
the winter months (September to March) the sun must be
south of the equator. The change in the sun’s distance
from the pole is also evident from the fact that in the winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
months the sun is on the whole lower down in the sky than
in summer, and that in particular its midday height is less.</p>

<p><a id="para_11"></a>11. The sun’s path on the celestial sphere is therefore
oblique to the equator, lying partly on one side of it and
partly on the other. A good deal of careful observation
of the kind we have been describing must, however, have
been necessary before it was ascertained that the sun’s
annual path on the celestial sphere (see fig. 4) is a <b>great
circle</b> (that is, a circle having its centre at the centre of
the sphere). This great circle is now called the <b>ecliptic</b>
(because eclipses take place only when the moon is in
or near it), and the angle at which it cuts the equator is
called the <b>obliquity</b> of the ecliptic. The Chinese claim to
have measured the obliquity in 1100 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and to have found
the remarkably accurate value 23° 52′ (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_35">§&nbsp;35</a>).
The truth of this statement may reasonably be doubted, but
on the other hand the statement of some late Greek writers
that either Pythagoras or Anaximander (6th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) was
the <i>first</i> to discover the
obliquity of the ecliptic is
almost certainly wrong. It
must have been known with
reasonable accuracy to both
Chaldaeans and Egyptians
long before.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>—The equator and the

</div>

<p>When the sun crosses the
equator the day is equal to
the night, and the times
when this occurs are consequently
known as the
<b>equinoxes</b>, the <b>vernal equinox</b>
occurring when the sun
crosses the equator from
south to north (about March
21st), and the <b>autumnal
equinox</b> when it crosses back (about September 23rd).
The points on the celestial sphere where the sun crosses
the equator (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> in fig. 4), <i>i.e.</i> where ecliptic and equator
cross one another, are called the <b>equinoctial points</b>,
occasionally also the equinoxes.</p>

<p>After the vernal equinox the sun in its path along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
ecliptic recedes from the equator towards the north, until it
reaches, about three months afterwards, its greatest distance
from the equator, and then approaches the equator again.
The time when the sun is at its greatest distance from the
equator on the north side is called the <b>summer solstice</b>,
because then the northward motion of the sun is arrested
and it temporarily appears to stand still. Similarly the sun
is at its greatest distance from the equator towards the
south at the <b>winter solstice</b>. The points on the ecliptic
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> in fig. 4) where the sun is at the solstices are called
the <b>solstitial points</b>, and are half-way between the equinoctial
points.</p>

<p><a id="para_12"></a>12. The earliest observers probably noticed particular
groups of stars remarkable for their form or for the presence
of bright stars among them, and occupied their fancy by
tracing resemblances between them and familiar objects, etc.
We have thus at a very early period a rough attempt at
dividing the stars into groups called <b>constellations</b> and at
naming the latter.</p>

<p>In some cases the stars regarded as belonging to a constellation
form a well-marked group on the sky, sufficiently
separated from other stars to be conveniently classed
together, although the resemblance which the group bears
to the object after which it is named is often very slight.
The seven bright stars of the Great Bear, for example, form
a group which any observer would very soon notice and
naturally make into a constellation, but the resemblance
to a bear of these and the fainter stars of the constellation
is sufficiently remote (see fig. 5), and as a matter of fact
this part of the Bear has also been called a Waggon and
is in America familiarly known as the Dipper; another
constellation has sometimes been called the Lyre and
sometimes also the Vulture. In very many cases the choice
of stars seems to have been made in such an arbitrary
manner, as to suggest that some fanciful figure was first
imagined and that stars were then selected so as to represent
it in some rough sort of way. In fact, as Sir John Herschel
remarks, “The constellations seem to have been purposely
named and delineated to cause as much confusion and
inconvenience as possible. Innumerable snakes twine
through long and contorted areas of the heavens where no
memory can follow them; bears, lions, and fishes, large and
small, confuse all nomenclature.” (<i>Outlines of Astronomy</i>,
§&nbsp;301.)</p>

<p>The constellations as we now have them are, with the
exception of a certain number (chiefly in the southern
skies) which have been added in modern times, substantially
those which existed in early Greek astronomy; and such
information as we possess of the Chaldaean and Egyptian
constellations shews resemblances indicating that the Greeks
borrowed some of them. The names, as far as they are
not those of animals or common objects (Bear, Serpent,
Lyre, etc.), are largely taken from characters in the Greek
mythology (Hercules, Perseus, Orion, etc.). The constellation
Berenice’s Hair, named after an Egyptian queen
of the 3rd century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, is one of the few which commemorate
a historical personage.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><a id="para_13"></a>13. Among the constellations which first received names
were those through which the sun passes in its annual
circuit of the celestial sphere, that is those through which
the ecliptic passes. The moon’s monthly path is also a great
circle, never differing very much from the ecliptic, and the
paths of the planets (<a href="#para_14">§&nbsp;14</a>) are such that they also are never
far from the ecliptic. Consequently the sun, the moon,
and the five planets were always to be found within a region
of the sky extending about 8° on each side of the ecliptic.
This strip of the celestial sphere was called the <b>zodiac</b>,
because the constellations in it were (with one exception)
named after living things (Greek ζῷον, an animal); it was
divided into twelve equal parts, the <b>signs of the zodiac</b>,
through one of which the sun passed every month, so that
the position of the sun at any time could be roughly
described by stating in what “sign” it was. The stars in
each “sign” were formed into a constellation, the “sign”
and the constellation each receiving the same name. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
arose twelve <b>zodiacal constellations</b>, the names of which
have come down to us with unimportant changes from
early Greek times.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Owing, however, to an alteration of
the position of the equator, and consequently of the
equinoctial points, the sign Aries, which was defined by
Hipparchus in the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> (see chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>)
as beginning at the vernal equinoctial point, no longer
contains the constellation Aries, but the preceding one,
Pisces: and there is a corresponding change throughout
the zodiac. The more precise numerical methods of
modern astronomy have, however, rendered the signs of
the zodiac almost obsolete: but the <b>first point of Aries</b> (♈),
and the <b>first point of Libra</b> (♎), are still the recognised
names for the equinoctial points.</p>

<p>In some cases individual stars also received special
names, or were called after the part of the constellation in
which they were situated, <i>e.g.</i> Sirius, the Eye of the Bull,
the Heart of the Lion, etc.; but the majority of the present
names of single stars are of Arabic origin (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_64">§&nbsp;64</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_14"></a>14. We have seen that the stars, as a whole, retain
invariable positions on the celestial sphere,<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> whereas the
sun and moon change their positions. It was, however,
discovered in prehistoric times that five bodies, at first
sight barely distinguishable from the other stars, also changed
their places. These five—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn—with the sun and moon, were called <b>planets</b>,<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
or wanderers, as distinguished from the <b>fixed stars</b>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Mercury is never seen except occasionally near the horizon
just after sunset or before sunrise, and in a climate like
ours requires a good deal of looking for; and it is rather
remarkable that no record of its discovery should exist.
Venus is conspicuous as the Evening Star or as the
Morning Star. The discovery of the identity of the
Evening and Morning Stars is attributed to Pythagoras
(6th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), but must almost certainly have been
made earlier, though the Homeric poems contain references
to both, without any indication of their identity. Jupiter is
at times as conspicuous as Venus at her brightest, while
Mars and Saturn, when well situated, rank with the brightest
of the fixed stars.</p>

<p>The paths of the planets on the celestial sphere are, as
we have seen (<a href="#para_13">§&nbsp;13</a>), never very far from the ecliptic; but
whereas the sun and moon move continuously along their
paths from west to east, the motion of a planet is sometimes
from west to east, or <b>direct</b>, and sometimes from east
to west, or <b>retrograde</b>. If we begin to watch a planet when
it is moving eastwards among the stars, we find that after
a time the motion becomes slower and slower, until the
planet hardly seems to move at all, and then begins to
move with gradually increasing speed in the opposite
direction; after a time this westward motion becomes
slower and then ceases, and the planet then begins to move
eastwards again, at first slowly and then faster, until it
returns to its original condition, and the changes are
repeated. When the planet is just reversing its motion it
is said to be <b>stationary</b>, and its position then is called a
<b>stationary point</b>. The time during which a planet’s motion
is retrograde is, however, always considerably less than that
during which it is direct; Jupiter’s motion, for example,
is direct for about 39 weeks and retrograde for 17, while
Mercury’s direct motion lasts 13 or 14 weeks and the retrograde
motion only about 3 weeks (see figs. 6, 7). On the
whole the planets advance from west to east and describe
circuits round the celestial sphere in periods which are
different for each planet. The explanation of these irregularities
in the planetary motions was long one of the great
difficulties of astronomy.</p>

<p><a id="para_15"></a>15. The idea that some of the heavenly bodies are
nearer to the earth than others must have been suggested
by eclipses (<a href="#para_17">§&nbsp;17</a>) and <b>occultations</b>, <i>i.e.</i> passages of the
moon over a planet or fixed star. In this way the moon
would be recognised as nearer than any of the other
celestial bodies. No direct means being available for
determining the distances, rapidity of motion was employed
as a test of probable nearness. Now Saturn returns to the
same place among the stars in about 29-1∕2 years, Jupiter in
12 years, Mars in 2 years, the sun in one year, Venus in 225
days, Mercury in 88 days, and the moon in 27 days; and
this order was usually taken to be the order of distance,
Saturn being the most distant, the moon the nearest. The
stars being seen above us it was natural to think of the
most distant celestial bodies as being the highest, and
accordingly Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars being beyond the
sun were called <b>superior planets</b>, as distinguished from the
two <b>inferior planets</b> Venus and Mercury. This division
corresponds also to a difference in the observed motions,
as Venus and Mercury seem to accompany the sun in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
annual journey, being never more than about 47 and 29°
respectively distant from it, on either side; while the other
planets are not thus restricted in their motions.</p>

<p><a id="para_16"></a>16. One of the purposes to which applications of
astronomical knowledge was first applied was to the
measurement of time. As the alternate appearance and
disappearance of the sun, bringing with it light and heat,
is the most obvious of astronomical facts, so the day is
the simplest unit of time.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Some of the early civilised
nations divided the time from sunrise to sunset and also
the night each into 12 equal hours. According to this
arrangement a day-hour was in summer longer than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
night-hour and in winter shorter, and the length of an hour
varied during the year. At Babylon, for example, where
this arrangement existed, the length of a day-hour was at
midsummer about half as long again as in midwinter, and
in London it would be about twice as long. It was therefore
a great improvement when the Greeks, in comparatively
late times, divided the whole day into 24 equal hours.
Other early nations divided the same period into 12 double
hours, and others again into 60 hours.</p>

<p>The next most obvious unit of time is the <b>lunar month</b>,
or period during which the moon goes through her phases.
A third independent unit is the year. Although the year
is for ordinary life much more important than the month,
yet as it is much longer and any one time of year is harder
to recognise than a particular phase of the moon, the length
of the year is more difficult to determine, and the earliest
known systems of time-measurement were accordingly
based on the month, not on the year. The month was
found to be nearly equal to 29-1∕2 days, and as a period
consisting of an exact number of days was obviously convenient
for most ordinary purposes, months of 29 or 30
days were used, and subsequently the calendar was brought
into closer accord with the moon by the use of months
containing alternately 29 and 30 days (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_19">§&nbsp;19</a>).</p>

<p>Both Chaldaeans and Egyptians appear to have known
that the year consisted of about 365-1∕4 days; and the latter,
for whom the importance of the year was emphasised by
the rising and falling of the Nile, were probably the first
nation to use the year in preference to the month as a
measure of time. They chose a year of 365 days.</p>

<p>The origin of the week is quite different from that of
the month or year, and rests on certain astrological ideas
about the planets. To each hour of the day one of the
seven planets (sun and moon included) was assigned as a
“ruler,” and each day named after the planet which ruled
its first hour. The planets being taken in the order
already given (<a href="#para_15">§&nbsp;15</a>), Saturn ruled the first hour of the
first day, and therefore also the 8th, 15th, and 22nd hours
of the first day, the 5th, 12th, and 19th of the second day,
and so on; Jupiter ruled the 2nd, 9th, 16th, and 23rd
hours of the first day, and subsequently the 1st hour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the 6th day. In this way the first hours of successive
days fell respectively to Saturn, the Sun, the Moon, Mars,
Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus. The first three are easily
recognised in our Saturday, Sunday, and Monday; in the
other days the names of the Roman gods have been
replaced by their supposed Teutonic equivalents—Mercury
by Wodan, Mars by Thues, Jupiter by Thor, Venus by
Freia.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p><a id="para_17"></a>17. <b>Eclipses</b> of the sun and moon must from very early
times have excited great interest, mingled with superstitious
terror, and the hope of acquiring some knowledge of them
was probably an important stimulus to early astronomical
work. That eclipses of the sun only take place at new
moon, and those of the moon only at full moon, must have
been noticed after very little observation; that eclipses of
the sun are caused by the passage of the moon in front
of it must have been only a little less obvious; but the
discovery that eclipses of the moon are caused by the
earth’s shadow was probably made much later. In fact
even in the time of Anaxagoras (5th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) the idea
was so unfamiliar to the Athenian public as to be regarded
as blasphemous.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of the Chaldaean contributions
to astronomy was the discovery (made at any
rate several centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) of the recurrence of eclipses
after a period, known as the <b>saros</b>, consisting of 6,585 days
(or eighteen of our years and ten or eleven days, according
as five or four leap-years are included). It is probable
that the discovery was made, not by calculations based on
knowledge of the motions of the sun and moon, but by
mere study of the dates on which eclipses were recorded
to have taken place. As, however, an eclipse of the sun
(unlike an eclipse of the moon) is only visible over a small
part of the surface of the earth, and eclipses of the sun
occurring at intervals of eighteen years are not generally
visible at the same place, it is not at all easy to see how
the Chaldaeans could have established their cycle for this
case, nor is it in fact clear that the saros was supposed to
apply to solar as well as to lunar eclipses. The saros may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
be illustrated in modern times by the eclipses of the sun
which took place on July 18th, 1860, on July 29th, 1878,
and on August 9th, 1896; but the first was visible in
Southern Europe, the second in North America, and the
third in Northern Europe and Asia.</p>

<p><a id="para_18"></a>18. To the Chaldaeans may be assigned also the doubtful
honour of having been among the first to develop <b>astrology</b>,
the false science which has professed to ascertain the influence
of the stars on human affairs, to predict by celestial
observations wars, famines, and pestilences, and to discover
the fate of individuals from the positions of the stars at
their birth. A belief in some form of astrology has always
prevailed in oriental countries; it flourished at times among
the Greeks and the Romans; it formed an important part
of the thought of the Middle Ages, and is not even quite
extinct among ourselves at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> It should,
however, be remembered that if the history of astrology is
a painful one, owing to the numerous illustrations which
it affords of human credulity and knavery, the belief in
it has undoubtedly been a powerful stimulus to genuine
astronomical study (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_56">§&nbsp;56</a>, and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>,
§§&nbsp;99, 100)</p>

<p><a id="para_19"></a>19. In the earlier period of Greek history one of the
chief functions expected of astronomers was the proper
regulation of the calendar. The Greeks, like earlier
nations, began with a calendar based on the moon. In
the time of Hesiod a year consisting of 12 months of 30
days was in common use; at a later date a year made up
of 6 <b>full</b> months of 30 days and 6 <b>empty</b> months of 29 days
was introduced. To Solon is attributed the merit of
having introduced at Athens, about 594 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, the practice
of adding to every alternate year a “full” month. Thus a
period of two years would contain 13 months of 30 days
and 12 of 29 days, or 738 days in all, distributed among
25 months, giving, for the average length of the year and
month, 369 days and about 29-1∕2 days respectively. This
arrangement was further improved by the introduction,
probably during the 5th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, of the <b>octaeteris</b>, or
eight-year cycle, in three of the years of which an additional
“full” month was introduced, while the remaining years
consisted as before of 6 “full” and 6 “empty” months.
By this arrangement the average length of the year was
reduced to 365-1∕4 days, that of the month remaining nearly
unchanged. As, however, the Greeks laid some stress on
beginning the month when the new moon was first visible,
it was necessary to make from time to time arbitrary
alterations in the calendar, and considerable confusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
resulted, of which Aristophanes makes the Moon complain
in his play <i>The Clouds</i>, acted in 423 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent20">“Yet you will not mark your days</div>
<div class="verse">As she bids you, but confuse them, jumbling them all sorts of ways.</div>
<div class="verse">And, she says, the Gods in chorus shower reproaches on her head,</div>
<div class="verse">When, in bitter disappointment, they go supperless to bed.</div>
<div class="verse">Not obtaining festal banquets, duly on the festal day.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><a id="para_20"></a>20. A little later, the astronomer <i>Meton</i> (born about
460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) made the discovery that the length of 19 years
is very nearly equal to that of 235 lunar months (the
difference being in fact less than a day), and he devised
accordingly an arrangement of 12 years of 12 months and
7 of 13 months, 125 of the months in the whole cycle
being “full” and the others “empty.” Nearly a century
later <i>Callippus</i> made a slight improvement, by substituting
in every fourth period of 19 years a “full” month for one of
the “empty” ones. Whether <b>Meton’s cycle</b>, as it is called,
was introduced for the civil calendar or not is uncertain,
but if not it was used as a standard by reference to which
the actual calendar was from time to time adjusted. The
use of this cycle seems to have soon spread to other parts
of Greece, and it is the basis of the present ecclesiastical
rule for fixing Easter. The difficulty of ensuring satisfactory
correspondence between the civil calendar and the actual
motions of the sun and moon led to the practice of publishing
from time to time tables (παραπήγματα) not unlike
our modern almanacks, giving for a series of years the
dates of the phases of the moon, and the rising and setting
of some of the fixed stars, together with predictions of the
weather. Owing to the same cause the early writers on
agriculture (<i>e.g.</i> Hesiod) fixed the dates for agricultural
operations, not by the calendar, but by the times of the
rising and setting of constellations, <i>i.e.</i> the times when
they first became visible before sunrise or were last visible
immediately after sunset—a practice which was continued
long after the establishment of a fairly satisfactory calendar,
and was apparently by no means extinct in the time of
Galen (2nd century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>).</p>

<p><a id="para_21"></a>21. The Roman calendar was in early times even more
confused than the Greek. There appears to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
at one time a year of either 304 or 354 days; tradition
assigned to Numa the introduction of a cycle of four years,
which brought the calendar into fair agreement with the
sun, but made the average length of the month considerably
too short. Instead, however, of introducing further
refinements the Romans cut the knot by entrusting to
the ecclesiastical authorities the adjustment of the
calendar from time to time, so as to make it agree with
the sun and moon. According to one account, the
first day of each month was proclaimed by a crier.
Owing either to ignorance, or, as was alleged, to political
and commercial favouritism, the priests allowed the
calendar to fall into a state of great confusion, so that,
as Voltaire remarked, “les généraux romains triomphaient
toujours, mais ils ne savaient pas quel jour ils triomphaient.”</p>

<p>A satisfactory reform of the calendar was finally effected
by Julius Caesar during the short period of his supremacy
at Rome, under the advice of an Alexandrine astronomer
<i>Sosigenes</i>. The error in the calendar had mounted up
to such an extent, that it was found necessary, in order
to correct it, to interpolate three additional months in
a single year (46 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), bringing the total number of days
in that year up to 445. For the future the year was to
be independent of the moon; the ordinary year was
to consist of 365 days, an extra day being added to February
every fourth year (our leap-year), so that the average
length of the year would be 365-1∕4 days.</p>

<p>The new system began with the year 45 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and soon
spread, under the name of the <b>Julian Calendar</b>, over the
civilised world.</p>

<p><a id="para_22"></a>22. To avoid returning to the subject, it may be convenient
to deal here with the only later reform of any
importance.</p>

<p>The difference between the average length of the
year as fixed by Julius Caesar and the true year is so
small as only to amount to about one day in 128 years. By
the latter half of the 16th century the date of the vernal
equinox was therefore about ten days earlier than it was
at the time of the Council of Nice (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 325), at which
rules for the observance of Easter had been fixed. Pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Gregory XIII. introduced therefore, in 1582, a slight change;,
ten days were omitted from that year, and it was arranged
to omit for the future three leap-years in four centuries
(viz. in 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc., the years 1600, 2000,
2400, etc., remaining leap-years). The <b>Gregorian Calendar</b>,
or <b>New Style</b>, as it was commonly called, was not adopted
in England till 1752, when 11 days had to be omitted;
and has not yet been adopted in Russia and Greece,
the dates there being now 12 days behind those of
Western Europe.</p>

<p><a id="para_23"></a>23. While their oriental predecessors had confined
themselves chiefly to astronomical observations, the earlier
Greek philosophers appear to have made next to no
observations of importance, and to have been far more
interested in inquiring into causes of phenomena. <i>Thales</i>,
the founder of the Ionian school, was credited by later
writers with the introduction of Egyptian astronomy into
Greece, at about the end of the 7th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; but both
Thales and the majority of his immediate successors appear
to have added little or nothing to astronomy, except some
rather vague speculations as to the form of the earth
and its relation to the rest of the world. On the other
hand, some real progress seems to have been made by
<i>Pythagoras</i><a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and his followers. Pythagoras taught that
the earth, in common with the heavenly bodies, is a sphere,
and that it rests without requiring support in the middle
of the universe. Whether he had any real evidence in
support of these views is doubtful, but it is at any rate
a reasonable conjecture that he knew the moon to be
bright because the sun shines on it, and the phases to
be caused by the greater or less amount of the illuminated
half turned towards us; and the curved form of the
boundary between the bright and dark portions of the
moon was correctly interpreted by him as evidence that
the moon was spherical, and not a flat disc, as it appears
at first sight. Analogy would then probably suggest that the
earth also was spherical. However this may be, the belief
in the spherical form of the earth never disappeared from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Greek thought, and was in later times an established part
of Greek systems, whence it has been handed down,
almost unchanged, to modern times. This belief is thus
2,000 years older than the belief in the rotation of
the earth and its revolution round the sun (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>),
doctrines which we are sometimes inclined to couple with
it as the foundations of modern astronomy.</p>

<p>In Pythagoras occurs also, perhaps for the first time, an
idea which had an extremely important influence on ancient
and mediaeval astronomy. Not only were the stars supposed
to be attached to a crystal sphere, which revolved daily
on an axis through the earth, but each of the seven
planets (the sun and moon being included) moved on a
sphere of its own. The distances of these spheres from
the earth were fixed in accordance with certain speculative
notions of Pythagoras as to numbers and music; hence
the spheres as they revolved produced harmonious sounds
which specially gifted persons might at times hear: this
is the origin of the idea of the <b>music of the spheres</b> which
recurs continually in mediaeval speculation and is found
occasionally in modern literature. At a later stage these
spheres of Pythagoras were developed into a scientific
representation of the motions of the celestial bodies, which
remained the basis of astronomy till the time of Kepler
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>).</p>

<p><a id="para_24"></a>24. The Pythagorean <i>Philolaus</i>, who lived about a
century later than his master, introduced for the first time
the idea of the motion of the earth: he appears to have
regarded the earth, as well as the sun, moon, and five
planets, as revolving round some central fire, the earth
rotating on its own axis as it revolved, apparently in order
to ensure that the central fire should always remain invisible
to the inhabitants of the known parts of the earth.
That the scheme was a purely fanciful one, and entirely
different from the modern doctrine of the motion of the
earth, with which later writers confused it, is sufficiently
shewn by the invention as part of the scheme of a purely
imaginary body, the counter-earth ([Greek: ἀντιχθών]), which brought
the number of moving bodies up to ten, a sacred Pythagorean
number. The suggestion of such an important
idea as that of the motion of the earth, an idea so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
repugnant to uninstructed common sense, although presented
in such a crude form, without any of the evidence required
to win general assent, was, however, undoubtedly a valuable
contribution to astronomical thought. It is well worth
notice that Coppernicus in the great book which is the
foundation of modern astronomy (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_75">§&nbsp;75</a>) especially
quotes Philolaus and other Pythagoreans as authorities
for his doctrine of the motion of the earth.</p>

<p>Three other Pythagoreans, belonging to the end of
the 6th century and to the 5th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, <i>Hicetas</i> of
Syracuse, <i>Heraclitus</i>, and <i>Ecphantus</i>, are explicitly mentioned
by later writers as having believed in the rotation of the
earth.</p>

<p>An obscure passage in one of Plato’s dialogues (the
<i>Timaeus</i>) has been interpreted by many ancient and modern
commentators as implying a belief in the rotation of the
earth, and Plutarch also tells us, partly on the authority
of Theophrastus, that Plato in old age adopted the belief
that the centre of the universe was not occupied by the
earth but by some better body.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Almost the only scientific Greek astronomer who believed
in the motion of the earth was <i>Aristarchus</i> of Samos, who
lived in the first half of the 3rd century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and is best
known by his measurements of the distances of the sun
and moon (<a href="#para_32">§&nbsp;32</a>). He held that the sun and fixed stars
were motionless, the sun being in the centre of the sphere
on which the latter lay, and that the earth not only rotated
on its axis, but also described an orbit round the sun.
<i>Seleucus</i> of Seleucia, who belonged to the middle of the
2nd century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, also held a similar opinion. Unfortunately
we know nothing of the grounds of this belief in
either case, and their views appear to have found little
favour among their contemporaries or successors.</p>

<p>It may also be mentioned in this connection that Aristotle
(<a href="#para_27">§&nbsp;27</a>) clearly realised that the apparent daily motion of the
stars could be explained by a motion either of the stars or
of the earth, but that he rejected the latter explanation.</p>

<p><a id="para_25"></a>25. <i>Plato</i> (about 428-347 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) devoted no dialogue
especially to astronomy, but made a good many references<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
to the subject in various places. He condemned any
careful study of the actual celestial motions as degrading
rather than elevating, and apparently regarded the subject
as worthy of attention chiefly on account of its connection
with geometry, and because the actual celestial motions
suggested ideal motions of greater beauty and interest.
This view of astronomy he contrasts with the popular
conception, according to which the subject was useful
chiefly for giving to the agriculturist, the navigator, and
others a knowledge of times and seasons.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> At the end
of the same dialogue he gives a short account of the
celestial bodies, according to which the sun, moon, planets,
and fixed stars revolve on eight concentric and closely
fitting wheels or circles round an axis passing through the
earth. Beginning with the body nearest to the earth, the
order is Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
stars. The Sun, Mercury, and Venus are said to perform
their revolutions in the same time, while the other planets
move more slowly, statements which shew that Plato was at
any rate aware that the motions of Venus and Mercury are
different from those of the other planets. He also states
that the moon shines by reflected light received from
the sun.</p>

<p>Plato is said to have suggested to his pupils as a worthy
problem the explanation of the celestial motions by means
of a combination of uniform circular or spherical motions.
Anything like an accurate theory of the celestial motions,
agreeing with actual observation, such as Hipparchus and
Ptolemy afterwards constructed with fair success, would
hardly seem to be in accordance with Plato’s ideas of the
true astronomy, but he may well have wished to see
established some simple and harmonious geometrical
scheme which would not be altogether at variance with
known facts.</p>

<p><a id="para_26"></a>26. Acting to some extent on this idea of Plato’s, <i>Eudoxus</i>
of Cnidus (about 409-356 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) attempted to explain the
most obvious peculiarities of the celestial motions by means
of a combination of uniform circular motions. He may be
regarded as representative of the transition from speculative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
to scientific Greek astronomy. As in the schemes of
several of his predecessors, the fixed stars lie on a sphere
which revolves daily about an axis through the earth; the
motion of each of the other bodies is produced by a combination
of other spheres, the centre of each sphere lying
on the surface of the preceding one. For the sun and
moon three spheres were in each case necessary: one to
produce the daily motion, shared by all the celestial
bodies; one to produce the annual or monthly motion in
the opposite direction along the ecliptic; and a third, with
its axis inclined to the axis of the preceding, to produce
the smaller motion to and from the ecliptic. Eudoxus
evidently was well aware that the moon’s path is not
coincident with the ecliptic, and even that its path is not
always the same, but changes continuously, so that the third
sphere was in this case necessary; on the other hand, he
could not possibly have been acquainted with the minute
deviations of the sun from the ecliptic with which modern
astronomy deals. Either therefore he used erroneous
observations, or, as is more probable, the sun’s third sphere
was introduced to explain a purely imaginary motion conjectured
to exist by “analogy” with the known motion of
the moon. For each of the five planets four spheres were
necessary, the additional one serving to produce the variations
in the speed of the motion and the reversal of the direction of
motion along the ecliptic (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_14">§&nbsp;14</a>, and below, <a href="#para_51">§&nbsp;51</a>).
Thus the celestial motions were to some extent explained
by means of a system of 27 spheres, 1 for the stars, 6 for
the sun and moon, 20 for the planets. There is no clear
evidence that Eudoxus made any serious attempt to arrange
either the size or the time of revolution of the spheres so as
to produce any precise agreement with the observed motions
of the celestial bodies, though he knew with considerable
accuracy the time required by each planet to return to the
same position with respect to the sun; in other words, his
scheme represented the celestial motions qualitatively but
not quantitatively. On the other hand, there is no reason
to suppose that Eudoxus regarded his spheres (with the
possible exception of the sphere of the fixed stars) as
material; his known devotion to mathematics renders it
probable that in his eyes (as in those of most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
scientific Greek astronomers who succeeded him) the
spheres were mere geometrical figures, useful as a means
of resolving highly complicated motions into simpler
elements. Eudoxus was also the first Greek recorded to
have had an observatory, which was at Cnidus, but we have
few details as to the instruments used or as to the observations
made. We owe, however, to him the first systematic
description of the constellations (see below, <a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>), though
it was probably based, to a large extent, on rough observations
borrowed from his Greek predecessors or from the
Egyptians. He was also an accomplished mathematician,
and skilled in various other branches of learning.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Callippus (<a href="#para_20">§&nbsp;20</a>) further developed
Eudoxus’s scheme of revolving spheres by adding, for
reasons not known to us, two spheres each for the sun
and moon and one each for Venus, Mercury, and Mars,
thus bringing the total number up to 34.</p>

<p><a id="para_27"></a>27. We have a tolerably full account of the astronomical
views of <i>Aristotle</i> (384-322 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), both by means of incidental
references, and by two treatises—the <i>Meteorologica</i>
and the <i>De Coelo</i>—though another book of his, dealing
specially with the subject, has unfortunately been lost. He
adopted the planetary scheme of Eudoxus and Callippus,
but imagined on “metaphysical grounds” that the spheres
would have certain disturbing effects on one another, and
to counteract these found it necessary to add 22 fresh
spheres, making 56 in all. At the same time he treated the
spheres as material bodies, thus converting an ingenious and
beautiful geometrical scheme into a confused mechanism.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
Aristotle’s spheres were, however, not adopted by the
leading Greek astronomers who succeeded him, the systems
of Hipparchus and Ptolemy being geometrical schemes
based on ideas more like those of Eudoxus.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="para_28"></a>28. Aristotle, in common with other philosophers of his
time, believed the heavens and the heavenly bodies to be
spherical. In the case of the moon he supports this belief
by the argument attributed to Pythagoras (<a href="#para_23">§&nbsp;23</a>), namely
that the observed appearances of the moon in its several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
phases are those which would be assumed by a spherical
body of which one half only is illuminated by the sun.
Thus the visible portion of the moon is bounded by two
planes passing nearly through its centre, perpendicular
respectively to the lines joining the centre of the moon to
those of the sun and earth. In the accompanying diagram,
which represents a section through the centres of the sun
(<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>), earth (<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>), and moon (<span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>), <span class="smcap lowercase">A B C D</span> representing on a
much enlarged scale a section of the moon itself, the
portion <span class="smcap lowercase">D A B</span> which is turned away from the sun is dark,
while the portion <span class="smcap lowercase">A D C</span>, being turned away from the
observer on the earth, is in any case invisible to him. The
part of the moon which appears bright is therefore that of
which <span class="smcap lowercase">B C</span> is a section, or the portion
represented by <span class="smcap lowercase">F B G C</span> in fig. 9 (which
represents the complete moon), which
consequently appears to the eye as
bounded by a semicircle <span class="smcap lowercase">F C G</span>, and a
portion <span class="smcap lowercase">F B G</span> of an oval curve (actually
an ellipse). The breadth of this bright
surface clearly varies with the relative
positions of sun, moon, and earth; so
that in the course of a month, during
which the moon assumes successively the positions relative
to sun and earth represented by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in
fig. 10, its appearances are those represented by the corresponding
numbers in fig. 11, the moon thus passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
through the familiar phases of crescent, half full, gibbous,
full moon, and gibbous, half full, crescent again.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>—The phases of the moon.</div>
</div>

<p>Aristotle then argues that as one heavenly body is
spherical, the others must be so also, and supports this
conclusion by another argument, equally inconclusive to
us, that a spherical form is appropriate to bodies moving as
the heavenly bodies appear to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_11"></a>

</div>

<p><a id="para_29"></a>29. His proofs that the earth is spherical are more interesting.
After discussing and rejecting various other
suggested forms, he points out that an eclipse of the moon
is caused by the shadow of the earth cast by the sun, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
argues from the circular form of the boundary of the shadow
as seen on the face of the moon during the progress of the
eclipse, or in a partial eclipse, that the earth must be
spherical; for otherwise it would cast a shadow of a different
shape. A second reason for the spherical form of
the earth is that when we move north and south the stars
change their positions with respect to the horizon, while
some even disappear and fresh ones take their place. This
shows that the direction of the stars has changed as compared
with the observer’s horizon; hence, the actual direction
of the stars being imperceptibly affected by any motion of
the observer on the earth, the horizons at two places, north
and south of one another, are in different directions, and the
earth is therefore curved. For
example, if a star is visible to an
observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> (fig. 12), while to
an observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> it is at the same
time invisible, <i>i.e.</i> hidden by the
earth, the surface of the earth
at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> must be in a different direction
from that at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. Aristotle
quotes further, in confirmation of
the roundness of the earth, that travellers from the far
East and the far West (practically India and Morocco)
alike reported the presence of elephants, whence it may be
inferred that the two regions in question are not very far
apart. He also makes use of some rather obscure arguments
of an <i>a priori</i> character.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—The curvature of
the earth.</div>
</div>

<p>There can be but little doubt that the readiness with
which Aristotle, as well as other Greeks, admitted the
spherical form of the earth and of the heavenly bodies,
was due to the affection which the Greeks always seem
to have had for the circle and sphere as being “perfect,”
<i>i.e.</i> perfectly symmetrical figures.</p>

<p><a id="para_30"></a>30. Aristotle argues against the possibility of the revolution
of the earth round the sun, on the ground that this
motion, if it existed, ought to produce a corresponding
apparent motion of the stars. We have here the first
appearance of one of the most serious of the many objections
ever brought against the belief in the motion of the earth,
an objection really only finally disposed of during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
present century by the discovery that such a motion of
the stars can be seen in a few cases, though owing to the
almost inconceivably great distance of the stars the motion
is imperceptible except by extremely refined methods of
observation (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_278">§§&nbsp;278</a>, 279). The question
of the distances of the several celestial bodies is also
discussed, and Aristotle arrives at the conclusion that the
planets are farther off than the sun and moon, supporting
his view by his observation of an occultation of Mars by
the moon (<i>i.e.</i> a passage of the moon in front of Mars), and
by the fact that similar observations had been made in the
case of other planets by Egyptians and Babylonians. It
is, however, difficult to see why he placed the planets
beyond the sun, as he must have known that the intense
brilliancy of the sun renders planets invisible in its neighbourhood,
and that no occultations of planets by the sun
could really have been seen even if they had been reported
to have taken place. He quotes also, as an opinion of
“the mathematicians,” that the stars must be at least nine
times as far off as the sun.</p>

<p>There are also in Aristotle’s writings a number of astronomical
speculations, founded on no solid evidence and of
little value; thus among other questions he discusses the
nature of comets, of the Milky Way, and of the stars, why
the stars twinkle, and the causes which produce the various
celestial motions.</p>

<p>In astronomy, as in other subjects, Aristotle appears
to have collected and systematised the best knowledge of
the time; but his original contributions are not only not
comparable with his contributions to the mental and moral
sciences, but are inferior in value to his work in other
natural sciences, <i>e.g.</i> Natural History. Unfortunately the
Greek astronomy of his time, still in an undeveloped state,
was as it were crystallised in his writings, and his great
authority was invoked, centuries afterwards, by comparatively
unintelligent or ignorant disciples in support of doctrines
which were plausible enough in his time, but which subsequent
research was shewing to be untenable. The advice
which he gives to his readers at the beginning of his exposition
of the planetary motions, to compare his views
with those which they arrived at themselves or met with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
elsewhere, might with advantage have been noted and
followed by many of the so-called Aristotelians of the
Middle Ages and of the Renaissance.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><a id="para_31"></a>31. After the time of Aristotle the centre of Greek
scientific thought moved to Alexandria. Founded by
Alexander the Great (who was for a time a pupil of
Aristotle) in 332 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, Alexandria was the capital of Egypt
during the reigns of the successive Ptolemies. These
kings, especially the second of them, surnamed Philadelphos,
were patrons of learning; they founded the
famous Museum, which contained a magnificent library
as well as an observatory, and Alexandria soon became
the home of a distinguished body of mathematicians and
astronomers. During the next five centuries the only
astronomers of importance, with the great exception of
Hipparchus (<a href="#para_37">§&nbsp;37</a>), were Alexandrines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—The method of Aristarchus for comparing the distances
of the sun and moon.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_32"></a>32. Among the earlier members of the Alexandrine
school were <i>Aristarchus</i> of Samos, <i>Aristyllus</i>, and <i>Timocharis</i>,
three nearly contemporary astronomers belonging
to the first half of the 3rd century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The views of
Aristarchus on the motion of the earth have already been
mentioned (<a href="#para_24">§&nbsp;24</a>). A treatise of his <i>On the Magnitudes
and Distances of the Sun and Moon</i> is still extant: he there
gives an extremely ingenious method for ascertaining the
comparative distances of the sun and moon. If, in the
figure, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> denote respectively the centres of the
earth, sun, and moon, the moon evidently appears to an
observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> half full when the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">E M S</span> is a right
angle. If when this is the case the angular distance
between the centres of the sun and moon, <i>i.e.</i> the angle
<span class="smcap lowercase">M E S</span>, is measured, two angles of the triangle <span class="smcap lowercase">M E S</span> are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
known; its shape is therefore completely determined, and
the ratio of its sides <span class="smcap lowercase">E M</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E S</span> can be calculated without
much difficulty. In fact, it being known (by a well-known
result in elementary geometry) that the angles at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>
are together equal to a right angle, the angle at <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> is
obtained by subtracting the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">S E M</span> from a right angle.
Aristarchus made the angle at <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> about 3°, and hence
calculated that the distance of the sun was from 18 to 20
times that of the moon, whereas, in fact, the sun is about 400
times as distant as the moon. The enormous error is due
to the difficulty of determining with sufficient accuracy the
moment when the moon is half full: the boundary separating
the bright and dark parts of the moon’s face is in reality
(owing to the irregularities on the surface of the moon) an ill-defined
and broken line (cf. fig. 53 and the frontispiece), so that
the observation on which Aristarchus based his work could
not have been made with any accuracy even with our modern
instruments, much less with those available in his time.
Aristarchus further estimated the apparent sizes of the sun
and moon to be about equal (as is shewn, for example, at
an eclipse of the sun, when the moon sometimes rather more
than hides the surface of the sun and sometimes does not
quite cover it), and inferred correctly that the real diameters
of the sun and moon were in proportion to their distances.
By a method based on eclipse observations which was
afterwards developed by Hipparchus (<a href="#para_41">§&nbsp;41</a>), 1∕3 that of the
earth, a result very near to the truth; and the same
method supplied data from which the distance of the moon
could at once have been expressed in terms of the radius
of the earth, but his work was spoilt at this point by a
grossly inaccurate estimate of the apparent size of the moon
(2° instead of 1∕2°), and his conclusions seem to contradict
one another. He appears also to have believed the distance
of the fixed stars to be immeasurably great as
compared with that of the sun. Both his speculative
opinions and his actual results mark therefore a decided
advance in astronomy.</p>

<p>Timocharis and Aristyllus were the first to ascertain and
to record the positions of the chief stars, by means of
numerical measurements of their distances from fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
positions on the sky; they may thus be regarded as the
authors of the first real star catalogue, earlier astronomers
having only attempted to fix the position of the stars by
more or less vague verbal descriptions. They also made a
number of valuable observations of the planets, the sun,
etc., of which succeeding astronomers, notably Hipparchus
and Ptolemy, were able to make good use.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="para_33"></a>33. Among the important contributions of the Greeks
to astronomy must be placed the development, chiefly from
the mathematical point of view, of the consequences of the
rotation of the celestial sphere and of some of the simpler
motions of the celestial bodies, a development the individual
steps of which it is difficult to trace. We have,
however, a series of minor treatises or textbooks, written
for the most part during the Alexandrine period, dealing
with this branch of the subject (known generally as
<b>Spherics</b>, or the Doctrine of the Sphere), of which the
<i>Phenomena</i> of the famous geometer <i>Euclid</i> (about 300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>)
is a good example. In addition to the points and circles
of the sphere already mentioned (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_8">§§&nbsp;8-11</a>), we
now find explicitly recognised the <b>horizon</b>, or the great
circle in which a horizontal plane through the observer
meets the celestial sphere, and its <b>pole</b>,<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> the <b>zenith</b>,<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
point on the celestial sphere vertically above the observer;
the <b>verticals</b>, or great circles through the zenith, meeting the
horizon at right angles; and the <b>declination circles</b>, which
pass through the north and south poles and cut the
equator at right angles. Another important great circle
was the <b>meridian</b>, passing through the zenith and the poles.
The well-known Milky Way had been noticed, and was
regarded as forming another great circle. There are also
traces of the two chief methods in common use at the
present day of indicating the position of a star on the
celestial sphere, namely, by reference either to the equator
or to the ecliptic. If through a star <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> we draw on the
sphere a portion of a great circle <span class="smcap lowercase">S N</span>, cutting the ecliptic ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>
at right angles in <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>, and another great circle (a declination
circle) cutting the equator at <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, and if ♈ be the first point of
Aries (<a href="#para_13">§&nbsp;13</a>), where the ecliptic crosses the equator, then
the position of the star is completely defined <i>either</i> by the
lengths of the arcs ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">N S</span>, which are called the <b>celestial
longitude</b> and <b>latitude</b> respectively, <i>or</i> by the arcs ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">M S</span>,
called respectively the <b>right ascension</b> and <b>declination</b>.<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
For some purposes it is more convenient to find the
position of the star by the first method, <i>i.e.</i> by reference
to the ecliptic; for other purposes in the second way, by
making use of the equator.</p>

<p><a id="para_34"></a>34. One of the applications of Spherics was to the construction
of sun-dials, which were supposed to have been
originally introduced into Greece from Babylon, but which
were much improved by the Greeks, and extensively used
both in Greek and in mediaeval times. The proper graduation
of sun-dials placed in various positions, horizontal,
vertical, and oblique, required considerable mathematical
skill. Much attention was also given to the time of the
rising and setting of the various constellations, and to
similar questions.</p>

<p><a id="para_35"></a>35. The discovery of the spherical form of the earth
led to a scientific treatment of the differences between the
seasons in different parts of the earth, and to a corresponding
division of the earth into zones. We have already
seen that the height of the pole above the horizon varies in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
different places, and that it was recognised that, if a traveller
were to go far enough north, he would find the pole to
coincide with the zenith, whereas by going south he would
reach a region (not very far beyond the limits of actual
Greek travel) where the pole would be on the horizon
and the equator consequently pass through the zenith; in
regions still farther south the north pole would be permanently
invisible, and the south pole would appear above
the horizon.</p>

<img src="images/i_p038.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>—The equator, the horizon,
and the meridian.</div>
</div>

<p>Further, if in the figure <span class="smcap lowercase">H E K W</span> represents the horizon,
meeting the equator <span class="smcap lowercase">Q E R W</span> in the east and west points <span class="smcap lowercase">E W</span>,
and the meridian <span class="smcap lowercase">H Q Z P K</span> in the south and north points
<span class="smcap lowercase">H</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">K</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span> being the zenith
and <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> the pole, then it is
easily seen that <span class="smcap lowercase">Q Z</span> is equal
to <span class="smcap lowercase">P K</span>, the height of the
pole above the horizon.
Any celestial body, therefore,
the distance of which
from the equator towards
the north (declination) is
less than <span class="smcap lowercase">P K</span>, will cross
the meridian to the south
of the zenith, whereas if
its declination be greater
than <span class="smcap lowercase">P K</span>, it will cross to
the north of the zenith.
Now the greatest distance
of the sun from the equator is equal to the angle between
the ecliptic and the equator, or about 23-1∕2°, Consequently
at places at which the height of the pole is less than 23-1∕2°
the sun will, during part of the year, cast shadows at midday
towards the south. This was known actually to be the case
not very far south of Alexandria. It was similarly recognised
that on the other side of the equator there must be
a region in which the sun ordinarily cast shadows towards
the south, but occasionally towards the north. These two
regions are the torrid zones of modern geographers.</p>

<p>Again, if the distance of the sun from the equator
is 23-1∕2°, its distance from the pole is 66-1∕2°; therefore in
regions so far north that the height <span class="smcap lowercase">P K</span> of the north pole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
is more than 66-1∕2°, the sun passes in summer into the
region of the circumpolar stars which never set (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>,
<a href="#para_9">§&nbsp;9</a>), and therefore during a portion of the summer the sun
remains continuously above the horizon. Similarly in the
same regions the sun is in winter so near the south pole
that for a time it remains continuously below the horizon.
Regions in which this occurs (our Arctic regions) were
unknown to Greek travellers, but their existence was clearly
indicated by the astronomers.</p>

<p><a id="para_36"></a>36. To <i>Eratosthenes</i> (276 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> to 195 or 196 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), another
member of the Alexandrine school, we owe one of the first
scientific estimates of the size of the earth. He found
that at the summer solstice the angular distance of the
sun from the zenith at Alexandria was at midday 1∕50th of
a complete circumference, or about 7°, whereas at Syene
in Upper Egypt the sun was known to be vertical at
the same time. From this he inferred, assuming Syene
to be due south of Alexandria, that the distance from
Syene to Alexandria was also 1∕50th of the circumference
of the earth. Thus if in the figure <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> denotes the sun, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> Alexandria and Syene respectively, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> the centre of
the earth, and <span class="smcap lowercase">A Z</span> the direction of the zenith at Alexandria,
Eratosthenes estimated the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">S A Z</span>, which, owing to
the great distance of <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, is sensibly equal to the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">S C A</span>,
to be 7°, and hence inferred that the arc <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span> was to the
circumference of the earth in the proportion of 7° to 360°
or 1 to 50. The distance between Alexandria and Syene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
being known to be 5,000 <i>stadia</i>, Eratosthenes thus arrived
at 250,000 stadia as an estimate of the circumference
of the earth, a number altered into 252,000 in order to
give an exact number of stadia (700) for each degree on the
earth. It is evident that the data employed were rough,
though the principle of the method is perfectly sound;
it is, however, difficult to estimate the correctness of the
result on account of the uncertainty as to the value of
the <i>stadium</i> used. If, as seems probable, it was the
common Olympic stadium, the result is about 20 per cent.
too great, but according to another interpretation<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> the
result is less than 1 per cent. in error (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_221">§&nbsp;221</a>).</p>

<p>Another measurement due to Eratosthenes was that
of the obliquity of the ecliptic, which he estimated at
22∕83 of a right angle, or 23° 51′, the error in which is only
about 7′.</p>

<p><a id="para_37"></a>37. An immense advance in astronomy was made by
<i>Hipparchus</i>, whom all competent critics have agreed to
rank far above any other astronomer of the ancient world,
and who must stand side by side with the greatest astronomers
of all time. Unfortunately only one unimportant
book of his has been preserved, and our knowledge of
his work is derived almost entirely from the writings of his
great admirer and disciple Ptolemy, who lived nearly three
centuries later (§§&nbsp;46 <i>seqq.</i>). We have also scarcely any
information about his life. He was born either at Nicaea
in Bithynia or in Rhodes, in which island he erected an
observatory and did most of his work. There is no
evidence that he belonged to the Alexandrine school,
though he probably visited Alexandria and may have made
some observations there. Ptolemy mentions observations
made by him in 146 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, 126 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and at many intermediate
dates, as well as a rather doubtful one of 161 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
The period of his greatest activity must therefore have been
about the middle of the 2nd century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Apart from individual astronomical discoveries, his chief
services to astronomy may be put under four heads. He
invented or greatly developed a special branch of mathe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>matics,<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
which enabled processes of numerical calculation
to be applied to geometrical figures, whether in a plane or
on a sphere. He made an extensive series of observations,
taken with all the accuracy that his instruments would
permit. He systematically and critically made use of old
observations for comparison with later ones so as to
discover astronomical changes too slow to be detected
within a single lifetime. Finally, he systematically employed
a particular geometrical scheme (that of eccentrics, and to
a less extent that of epicycles) for the representation of the
motions of the sun and moon.</p>

<p><a id="para_38"></a>38. The merit of suggesting that the motions of the
heavenly bodies could be represented more simply by combinations
of uniform <i>circular</i> motions than by the revolving
<i>spheres</i> of Eudoxus and his school (<a href="#para_26">§&nbsp;26</a>) is generally
attributed to the great Alexandrine mathematician <i>Apollonius</i>
of Perga, who lived in the latter half of the 3rd
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, but there is no clear evidence that he worked
out a system in any detail.</p>

<p>On account of the important part that this idea played
in astronomy for nearly 2,000 years, it may be worth
while to examine in some detail Hipparchus’s theory of
the sun, the simplest and most successful application of
the idea.</p>

<p>We have already seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_10">§&nbsp;10</a>) that, in addition
to the daily motion (from east to west) which it shares with
the rest of the celestial bodies, and of which we need here
take no further account, the sun has also an annual motion
on the celestial sphere in the reverse direction (from west
to east) in a path oblique to the equator, which was early
recognised as a great circle, called the ecliptic. It must
be remembered further that the celestial sphere, on which
the sun appears to lie, is a mere geometrical fiction
introduced for convenience; all that direct observation
gives is the change in the sun’s direction, and therefore
the sun may consistently be supposed to move in such a
way as to vary its distance from the earth in any arbitrary
manner, provided only that the alterations in the apparent
size of the sun, caused by the variations in its distance,
agree with those observed, or that at any rate the differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
are not great enough to be perceptible. It was, moreover,
known (probably long before the time of Hipparchus) that
the sun’s apparent motion in the ecliptic is not quite
uniform, the motion at some times of the year being
slightly more rapid than at others.</p>

<p>Supposing that we had such a complete set of observations
of the motion of the sun, that we knew its position
from day to day, how should we set to work to record and
describe its motion? For practical purposes nothing could
be more satisfactory than the method adopted in our
almanacks, of giving from day to day the position of the
sun; after observations extending over a few years it would
not be difficult to verify that the motion of the sun is (after
allowing for the irregularities of our calendar) from year to
year the same, and to predict in this way the place of the
sun from day to day in future years.</p>

<p>But it is clear that such a description would not only
be long, but would be felt as unsatisfactory by any one
who approached the question from the point of view of
intellectual curiosity or scientific interest. Such a person
would feel that these detailed facts ought to be capable
of being exhibited as consequences of some simpler general
statement.</p>

<p>A modern astronomer would effect this by expressing
the motion of the sun by means of an algebraical formula,
<i>i.e.</i> he would represent the velocity of the sun or its
distance from some fixed point in its path by some
symbolic expression representing a quantity undergoing
changes with the time in a certain definite way, and
enabling an expert to compute with ease the required
position of the sun at any assigned instant.<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>The Greeks, however, had not the requisite algebraical
knowledge for such a method of representation, and Hipparchus,
like his predecessors, made use of a geometrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
representation of the required variations in the sun’s motion
in the ecliptic, a method of representation which is in some
respects more intelligible and vivid than the use of algebra,
but which becomes unmanageable in complicated cases.
It runs moreover the risk of being taken for a mechanism.
The circle, being the simplest curve known, would naturally
be thought of, and as any motion other than a uniform
motion would itself require a special representation, the
idea of Apollonius, adopted by Hipparchus, was to devise
a proper combination of uniform circular motions.</p>

<p><a id="para_39"></a>39. The simplest device that was found to be satisfactory
in the case of the sun was the use of the <b>eccentric</b>, <i>i.e.</i> a
circle the centre of which (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) does not coincide with the
position of the observer on the earth (<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>). If in fig. 17 a
point, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, describes the eccentric circle <span class="smcap lowercase">A F G B</span> uniformly,
so that it always passes over equal arcs of the circle in
equal times and the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A C S</span> increases uniformly, then
it is evident that the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A E S</span>, or the apparent distance
of <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> from <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, does not increase uniformly. When <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> is near
the point <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, which is farthest from the earth and hence
called the <b>apogee</b>, it appears on account of its greater
distance from the observer to move more slowly than when
near <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>; and it appears to move fastest when near <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
the point nearest to <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, hence called the <b>perigee</b>. Thus the
motion of <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> varies in the same sort of way as the motion
of the sun as actually observed. Before, however, the
eccentric could be considered as satisfactory, it was necessary
to show that it was possible to choose the direction
of the line <span class="smcap lowercase">B E C A</span> (the <b>line of apses</b>) which determines the
positions of the sun when moving fastest and when moving
most slowly, and the magnitude of the ratio of <span class="smcap lowercase">E C</span> to the
radius <span class="smcap lowercase">C A</span> of the circle (the <b>eccentricity</b>), so as to make
the calculated positions of the sun in various parts of its
path differ from the observed positions at the corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
times of year by quantities so small that they might fairly
be attributed to errors of observation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_17"></a>
<img src="images/i_p044.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>—The eccentric.</div>
</div>

<p>This problem was much more difficult than might at first
sight appear, on account of the great difficulty experienced
in Greek times and long afterwards in getting satisfactory
observations of the sun. As the sun and stars are not
visible at the same time, it is not possible to measure
directly the distance of the sun from neighbouring stars
and so to fix its place on the celestial sphere. But it
is possible, by measuring the length of the shadow cast by
a rod at midday, to ascertain with fair accuracy the height
of the sun above the horizon, and hence to deduce its
distance from the equator, or the declination (figs. 3, 14).
This one quantity does not suffice to fix the sun’s position,
but if also the sun’s right ascension (<a href="#para_33">§&nbsp;33</a>), or its distance
east and west from the stars, can be accurately ascertained,
its place on the celestial sphere is completely determined.
The methods available for determining this second quantity
were, however, very imperfect. One method was to note
the time between the passage of the sun across some fixed
position in the sky (<i>e.g.</i> the meridian), and the passage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
a star across the same place, and thus to ascertain the
angular distance between them (the celestial sphere being
known to turn through 15° in an hour), a method which
with modern clocks is extremely accurate, but with the
rough water-clocks or sand-glasses of former times was very
uncertain. In another method the moon was used as a
connecting link between sun and stars, her position relative
to the latter being observed by night, and with respect to
the former by day; but owing to the rapid motion of the
moon in the interval between the two observations, this
method also was not susceptible of much accuracy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_18"></a>
<img src="images/i_p045.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>—The position of the sun’s apogee.</div>
</div>

<p>In the case of the particular problem of the determination
of the line of apses, Hipparchus made use of
another method, and his skill is shewn in a striking manner
by his recognition that both the eccentricity and position
of the apse line could be determined from a knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the lengths of two of the seasons of the year, <i>i.e.</i> of the
intervals into which the year is divided by the solstices
and the equinoxes (<a href="#para_11">§&nbsp;11</a>). By means of his own observations,
and of others made by his predecessors, he ascertained
the length of the spring (from the vernal equinox to
the summer solstice) to be 94 days, and that of the summer
(summer solstice to autumnal equinox) to be 92-1∕2 days, the
length of the year being 365-1∕4 days. As the sun moves
in each season through the same angular distance, a right
angle, and as the spring and summer make together more
than half the year, and the spring is longer than the
summer, it follows that the sun must, on the whole, be
moving more slowly during the spring than in any other
season, and that it must therefore pass through the apogee
in the spring. If, therefore, in fig. 18, we draw two
perpendicular lines <span class="smcap lowercase">Q E S</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">P E R</span> to represent the directions
of the sun at the solstices and equinoxes, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> corresponding
to the vernal equinox and <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> to the autumnal equinox, the
apogee must lie at some point <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> between <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>. So
much can be seen without any mathematics: the actual
calculation of the position of <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and of the eccentricity is
a matter of some complexity. The angle <span class="smcap lowercase">P E A</span> was found
to be about 65°, so that the sun would pass through its
apogee about the beginning of June; and the eccentricity
was estimated at 1∕24.</p>

<p>The motion being thus represented geometrically, it
became merely a matter of not very difficult calculation to
construct a table from which the position of the sun for
any day in the year could be easily deduced. This was
done by computing the so-called <b>equation of the centre</b>,
the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">C S E</span> of fig. 17, which is the excess of the actual
longitude of the sun over the longitude which it would
have had if moving uniformly.</p>

<p>Owing to the imperfection of the observations used
(Hipparchus estimated that the times of the equinoxes and
solstices could only be relied upon to within about half a
day), the actual results obtained were not, according to
modern ideas, very accurate, but the theory represented
the sun’s motion with an accuracy about as great as that
of the observations. It is worth noticing that with the
same theory, but with an improved value of the eccentricity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the motion of the sun can be represented so accurately
that the error never exceeds about 1′, a quantity insensible
to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The theory of Hipparchus represents the variations in
the distance of the sun with much less accuracy, and
whereas in fact the angular diameter of the sun varies by
about 1∕30th part of itself, or by about 1′ in the course of
the year, this variation according to Hipparchus should be
about twice as great. But this error would also have been
quite imperceptible with his instruments.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<a id="Fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/i_p047.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>—The epicycle and the deferent.</div>
</div>

<p>Hipparchus saw that the motion of the sun could equally
well be represented by the other device suggested by
Apollonius, the <b>epicycle</b>.
The body the
motion of which is to be
represented is supposed
to move uniformly
round the circumference
of one circle, called the
epicycle, the centre of
which in turn moves on
another circle called the
<b>deferent</b>. It is in fact
evident that if a circle
equal to the eccentric,
but with its centre at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>
(fig. 19), be taken as
the deferent, and if <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>
be taken on this so that <span class="smcap lowercase">E S′</span> is parallel to <span class="smcap lowercase">C S</span>, then <span class="smcap lowercase">S′ S</span> is
parallel and equal to <span class="smcap lowercase">E C</span>; and that therefore the sun <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, moving
uniformly on the eccentric, may equally well be regarded
as lying on a circle of radius <span class="smcap lowercase">S′ S</span>, the centre <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> of which
moves on the deferent. The two constructions lead in
fact in this particular problem to exactly the same result,
and Hipparchus chose the eccentric as being the simpler.</p>

<p><a id="para_40"></a>40. The motion of the moon being much more complicated
than that of the sun has always presented difficulties
to astronomers,<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and Hipparchus required for it a more
elaborate construction. Some further description of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
moon’s motion is, however, necessary before discussing his
theory.</p>

<p>We have already spoken (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_16">§&nbsp;16</a>) of the lunar
month as the period during which the moon returns to the
same position with respect to the sun; more precisely this
period (about 29-1∕2 days) is spoken of as a <b>lunation</b> or
<b>synodic month</b>: as, however, the sun moves eastward on
the celestial sphere like the moon but more slowly, the
moon returns to the same position with respect to the
<i>stars</i> in a somewhat shorter time; this period (about 27
days 8 hours) is known as the <b>sidereal month</b>. Again, the
moon’s path on the celestial sphere is slightly inclined to
the ecliptic, and may be regarded approximately as a great
circle cutting the ecliptic in two <b>nodes</b>, at an angle which
Hipparchus was probably the first to fix definitely at
about 5°. Moreover, the moon’s path is always changing
in such a way that, the inclination to the ecliptic remaining
nearly constant (but cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_111">§&nbsp;111</a>), the nodes move
slowly backwards (from east to west) along the ecliptic,
performing a complete revolution in about 19 years. It is
therefore convenient to give a special name, the <b>draconitic
month</b>,<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> to the period (about 27 days 5 hours) during which
the moon returns to the same position with respect to the
nodes.</p>

<p>Again, the motion of the moon, like that of the sun, is
not uniform, the variations being greater than in the case
of the sun. Hipparchus appears to have been the first to
discover that the part of the moon’s path in which the
motion is most rapid is not always in the same position on
the celestial sphere, but moves continuously; or, in other
words, that the line of apses (<a href="#para_39">§&nbsp;39</a>) of the moon’s path
moves. The motion is an advance, and a complete circuit
is described in about nine years. Hence arises a fourth
kind of month, the <b>anomalistic month</b>, which is the period
in which the moon returns to apogee or perigee.</p>

<p>To Hipparchus is due the credit of fixing with greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
exactitude than before the lengths of each of these months.
In order to determine them with accuracy he recognised
the importance of comparing observations of the moon
taken at as great a distance of time as possible, and saw
that the most satisfactory results could be obtained by
using Chaldaean and other eclipse observations, which,
as eclipses only take place near the moon’s nodes, were
simultaneous records of the position of the moon, the
nodes, and the sun.</p>

<p>To represent this complicated set of motions, Hipparchus
used, as in the case of the sun, an eccentric, the centre of
which described a circle round the earth in about nine
years (corresponding to the motion of the apses), the plane
of the eccentric being inclined to the ecliptic at an angle
of 5°, and sliding back, so as to represent the motion of
the nodes already described.</p>

<p>The result cannot, however, have been as satisfactory as
in the case of the sun. The variation in the rate at which
the moon moves is not only greater than in the case of
the sun, but follows a less simple law, and cannot be adequately
represented by means of a single eccentric; so
that though Hipparchus’ work would have represented the
motion of the moon in certain parts of her orbit with fair
accuracy, there must necessarily have been elsewhere discrepancies
between the calculated and observed places.
There is some indication that Hipparchus was aware of
these, but was not able to reconstruct his theory so as to
account for them.</p>

<p><a id="para_41"></a>41. In the case of the planets Hipparchus found so
small a supply of satisfactory observations by his predecessors,
that he made no attempt to construct a system
of epicycles or eccentrics to represent their motion, but
collected fresh observations for the use of his successors.
He also made use of these observations to determine with
more accuracy than before the average times of revolution
of the several planets.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>—The eclipse method
of connecting the distances
of the sun and moon.</div>
</div>

<p>He also made a satisfactory estimate of the size and
distance of the moon, by an eclipse method, the leading
idea of which was due to Aristarchus (<a href="#para_32">§&nbsp;32</a>); by observing
the angular diameter of the earth’s shadow (<span class="smcap lowercase">Q R</span>) at the
distance of the moon at the time of an eclipse, and comparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
it with the known angular diameters
of the sun and moon,
he obtained, by a simple calculation,<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
a relation between the distances of the sun and
moon, which gives either when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the other is known. Hipparchus knew that the sun was
very much more distant than the moon, and appears to
have tried more than one distance, that of Aristarchus among
them, and the result obtained in each case shewed that
the distance of the moon was nearly 59 times the radius
of the earth. Combining the estimates of Hipparchus and
Aristarchus, we find the distance of the sun to be about 1,200
times the radius of the earth—a number which remained substantially
unchanged for many centuries (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_42"></a>42. The appearance in 134 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> of a new star in the
Scorpion is said to have suggested to Hipparchus the
construction of a new catalogue of the stars. He included
1,080 stars, and not only gave the (celestial) latitude and
longitude of each star, but divided them according to their
brightness into six magnitudes. The constellations to which
he refers are nearly identical with those of Eudoxus (<a href="#para_26">§&nbsp;26</a>),
and the list has undergone few alterations up to the present
day, except for the addition of a number of southern constellations,
invisible in the civilised countries of the ancient
world. Hipparchus recorded also a number of cases in
which three or more stars appeared to be in line with one
another, or, more exactly, lay on the same great circle,
his object being to enable subsequent observers to detect
more easily possible changes in the positions of the stars.
The catalogue remained, with slight alterations, the standard
one for nearly sixteen centuries (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_63">§&nbsp;63</a>).</p>

<p>The construction of this catalogue led to a notable
discovery, the best known probably of all those which
Hipparchus made. In comparing his observations of certain
stars with those of Timocharis and Aristyllus (<a href="#para_33">§&nbsp;33</a>), made
about a century and a half earlier, Hipparchus found that
their distances from the equinoctial points had changed.
Thus, in the case of the bright star Spica, the distance
from the equinoctial points (measured eastwards) had
increased by about 2° in 150 years, or at the rate of 48″ per
annum. Further inquiry showed that, though the roughness
of the observations produced considerable variations in the
case of different stars, there was evidence of a general
increase in the longitude of the stars (measured from west
to east), unaccompanied by any change of latitude, the
amount of the change being estimated by Hipparchus as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
at least 36″ annually, and possibly more. The agreement
between the motions of different stars was enough to
justify him in concluding that the change could be
accounted for, not as a motion of individual stars, but
rather as a change in the position of the equinoctial
points, from which longitudes were measured. Now these
points are the intersection of the equator and the ecliptic:
consequently one or another of these two circles must have
changed. But the fact that the latitudes of the stars had
undergone no change shewed that the ecliptic must have
retained its position and that the change had been caused
by a motion of the equator. Again, Hipparchus measured
the obliquity of the ecliptic as several of his predecessors
had done, and the results indicated no appreciable change.
Hipparchus accordingly inferred that the equator was, as
it were, slowly sliding backwards (<i>i.e.</i> from east to west),
keeping a constant inclination to the ecliptic.</p>

</div>

<p>The argument may be made clearer by figures. In
fig. 21 let ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> denote the ecliptic, ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span> the equator, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> a
star as seen by Timocharis, <span class="smcap lowercase">S M</span> a great circle drawn perpendicular
to the ecliptic. Then <span class="smcap lowercase">S M</span> is the latitude, ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>
the longitude. Let <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> denote the star as seen by Hipparchus;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
then he found, that <span class="smcap lowercase">S′ M</span> was equal to the former <span class="smcap lowercase">S M</span>,
but that ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">M′</span> was greater than the former ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, or that <span class="smcap lowercase">M′</span>
was slightly to the east of <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>. This change <span class="smcap lowercase">M M′</span> being
nearly the same for all stars, it was simpler to attribute it
to an equal motion in the
opposite direction of the
point ♈, say from ♈ to ♈′
(fig. 22), <i>i.e.</i> by a motion of
the equator from ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span> to
♈′ <span class="smcap lowercase">N′</span>, its inclination <span class="smcap lowercase">N′</span> ♈′ <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>
remaining equal to its former
amount <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span> ♈ <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>. The general
effect of this change is shewn
in a different way in fig. 23,
where ♈ ♈′ ♎ ♎′ being the

the equator as it appeared

<span class="smcap lowercase">A′ B′ C′ D′</span> (printed in red)
the same in the time of

</div>

<p>The annual motion ♈ ♈′ was, as has been stated, estimated
by Hipparchus as being at least 36″ (equivalent to one
degree in a century), and probably more. Its true value is
considerably more, namely about 50″.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_24"></a>
<img src="images/i_p054.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>—The precession of the equinoxes.</div>
</div>
<p>An important consequence of the motion of the equator
thus discovered is that the sun in its annual journey round
the ecliptic, after starting from the equinoctial point, returns
to the new position of the equinoctial point a little before
returning to its original position with respect to the stars,
and the successive equinoxes occur slightly earlier than they
otherwise would. From this fact is derived the name <b>precession
of the equinoxes</b>, or more shortly, <b>precession</b>, which
is applied to the motion that we have been considering.
Hence it becomes necessary to recognise, as Hipparchus
did, two different kinds of year, the <b>tropical year</b> or period
required by the sun to return to the same position with
respect to the equinoctial points, and the <b>sidereal year</b> or
period of return to the same position with respect to the
stars. If ♈ ♈′ denote the motion of the equinoctial point
during a tropical year, then the sun after starting from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
equinoctial point at ♈ arrives—at the end of a tropical
year—at the new equinoctial point at ♈′; but the sidereal
year is only complete when the sun has further described
the arc ♈′ ♈ and returned to its original starting-point ♈.
Hence, taking the modern estimate 50″ of the arc ♈ ♈′, the
sun, in the sidereal year, describes an arc of 360°, in the
tropical year an arc less by 50″, or 359° 59′ 10″; the lengths
of the two years are therefore in this proportion, and the
amount by which the sidereal year exceeds the tropical
year bears to either the same ratio as 50″ to 360° (or
1,296,000″), and is therefore (365-1∕4 × 50)∕1296000 days of about 20
minutes.</p>

<p>Another way of expressing the amount of the precession
is to say that the equinoctial point will describe the
complete circuit of the ecliptic and return to the same
position after about 26,000 years.</p>

<p>The length of each kind of year was also fixed
by Hipparchus with considerable accuracy. That of
the tropical year was obtained by comparing the times
of solstices and equinoxes observed by earlier astronomers
with those observed by himself. He found, for
example, by comparison of the date of the summer solstice
of 280 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, observed by Aristarchus of Samos, with that
of the year 135 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, that the current estimate of 365-1∕4
days for the length of the year had to be diminished
by 1∕300th of a day or about five minutes, an estimate
confirmed roughly by other cases. It is interesting to
note as an illustration of his scientific method that he
discusses with some care the possible error of the observations,
and concludes that the time of a solstice may be
erroneous to the extent of about 3∕4 day, while that of an
equinox may be expected to be within 1∕4 day of the truth.
In the illustration given, this would indicate a possible
error of 1-1∕2 days in a period of 145 years, or about 15
minutes in a year. Actually his estimate of the length of
the year is about six minutes too great, and the error is
thus much less than that which he indicated as possible.
In the course of this work he considered also the possibility
of a change in the length of the year, and arrived at the
conclusion that, although his observations were not precise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
enough to show definitely the invariability of the year, there
was no evidence to suppose that it had changed.</p>

<p>The length of the tropical year being thus evaluated at
365 days 5 hours 55 minutes, and the difference between
the two kinds of year being given by the observations of
precession, the sidereal year was ascertained to exceed
365-1∕4 days by about 10 minutes, a result agreeing almost
exactly with modern estimates. That the addition of two
erroneous quantities, the length of the tropical year and the
amount of the precession, gave such an accurate result was
not, as at first sight appears, a mere accident. The chief
source of error in each case being the erroneous times of
the several equinoxes and solstices employed, the errors
in them would tend to produce errors of opposite kinds
in the tropical year and in precession, so that they would in
part compensate one another. This estimate of the length
of the sidereal year was probably also to some extent
verified by Hipparchus by comparing eclipse observations
made at different epochs.</p>

<p><a id="para_43"></a>43. The great improvements which Hipparchus effected
in the theories of the sun and moon naturally enabled him
to deal more successfully than any of his predecessors with
a problem which in all ages has been of the greatest interest,
the prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon.</p>

<p>That eclipses of the moon were caused by the passage
of the moon through the shadow of the earth thrown by
the sun, or, in other words, by the interposition of the
earth between the sun and moon, and eclipses of the sun
by the passage of the moon between the sun and the
observer, was perfectly well known to Greek astronomers
in the time of Aristotle (<a href="#para_29">§&nbsp;29</a>), and probably much earlier
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_17">§&nbsp;17</a>), though the knowledge was probably
confined to comparatively few people and superstitious
terrors were long associated with eclipses.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in dealing with eclipses depends
on the fact that the moon’s path does not coincide
with the ecliptic. If the moon’s path on the celestial
sphere were identical with the ecliptic, then, once every
month, at new moon, the moon (<span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>) would pass exactly
between the earth and the sun, and the latter would be
eclipsed, and once every month also, at full moon, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
moon (<span class="smcap lowercase">M′</span>) would be in the opposite direction to the sun
as seen from the earth, and would consequently be obscured
by the shadow of the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_25"></a>

<img src="images/i_p057.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 26.—The ecliptic and the moon’s path.</div>
</div>

<p>As, however, the moon’s path is inclined to the ecliptic
(<a href="#para_40">§&nbsp;40</a>), the latitudes of the sun and moon may differ by
as much as 5°, either when they are in <b>conjunction</b>, <i>i.e.</i>
when they have the same longitudes, or when they are
in <b>opposition</b>, <i>i.e.</i> when their longitudes differ by 180°,
and they will then in either case be too far apart for an
eclipse to occur. Whether then at any full or new moon
an eclipse will occur or not, will depend primarily on the
latitude of the moon at the time, and hence upon her
position with respect to the nodes of her orbit (<a href="#para_40">§&nbsp;40</a>). If
conjunction takes place when the sun and moon happen
to be near one of the nodes (<span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>), as at <span class="smcap lowercase">S M</span> in fig. 26, the
sun and moon will be so close together that an eclipse
will occur; but if it occurs at a considerable distance from
a node, as at <span class="smcap lowercase">S′ M′</span>, their centres are so far apart that no
eclipse takes place.</p>

<p>Now the apparent diameter of either sun or moon is,
as we have seen (<a href="#para_32">§&nbsp;32</a>), about 1∕2°; consequently when their
discs just touch, as in fig. 27, the distance between their
centres is also about 1∕2°. If then at conjunction the distance
between their centres is less than this amount, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
eclipse of the sun will take place; if not, there will be no
eclipse. It is an easy calculation to determine (in fig. 26)
the length of the side <span class="smcap lowercase">N S</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">N M</span> of the triangle <span class="smcap lowercase">N M S</span>,
when <span class="smcap lowercase">S M</span> has this value, and hence to
determine the greatest distance from the
node at which conjunction can take place
if an eclipse is to occur. An eclipse of
the moon can be treated in the same way,
except that we there have to deal with the
moon and the shadow of the earth at the
distance of the moon. The apparent size
of the shadow is, however, considerably
greater than the apparent size of the moon,
and an eclipse of the moon takes place if
the distance between the centre of the moon and the centre
of the shadow is less than about 1°. As before, it is easy
to compute the distance of the moon or of the centre of the
shadow from the node when opposition occurs, if an eclipse
just takes place. As, however, the apparent sizes of both
sun and moon, and consequently also that of the earth’s
shadow, vary according to the distances of the sun and
moon, a variation of which Hipparchus had no accurate
knowledge, the calculation becomes really a good deal more
complicated than at first sight appears, and was only dealt
with imperfectly by him.</p>

<p>Eclipses of the moon are divided into <b>partial</b> or <b>total</b>,
the former occurring when the moon and the earth’s
shadow only overlap partially (as in fig. 28), the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
when the moon’s disc is completely immersed in the
shadow (fig. 29). In the same way an eclipse of the sun
may be partial or total; but as the sun’s disc may be at
times slightly larger than that of the moon, it sometimes
happens also that the whole disc of the sun is hidden
by the moon, except a narrow ring round the edge (as
in fig. 30): such an eclipse is called <b>annular</b>. As the
earth’s shadow at the distance of the moon
is always larger than the moon’s disc, annular
eclipses of the moon cannot occur.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>—Annular
eclipse of the
sun.</div>
</div>

<p>Thus eclipses take place if, and only if,
the distance of the moon from a node at
the time of conjunction or opposition lies
within certain limits approximately known;
and the problem of predicting eclipses
could be roughly solved by such knowledge
of the motion of the moon and of the nodes as Hipparchus
possessed. Moreover, the length of the synodic and
draconitic months (<a href="#para_40">§&nbsp;40</a>) being once ascertained, it became
merely a matter of arithmetic to compute one or more
periods after which eclipses would recur nearly in the same
manner. For if any period of time contains an exact
number of each kind of month, and if at any time an
eclipse occurs, then after the lapse of the period, conjunction
(or opposition) again takes place, and the moon
is at the same distance as before from the node and the
eclipse recurs very much as before. The saros, for example
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_17">§&nbsp;17</a>), contained very nearly 223 synodic or
242 draconitic months, differing from either by less than
an hour. Hipparchus saw that this period was not completely
reliable as a means of predicting eclipses, and
showed how to allow for the irregularities in the moon’s
and sun’s motion (§§&nbsp;39, 40) which were ignored by it,
but was unable to deal fully with the difficulties arising
from the variations in the apparent diameters of the sun
or moon.</p>

<p>An important complication, however, arises in the case
of eclipses of the sun, which had been noticed by earlier
writers, but which Hipparchus was the first to deal with.
Since an eclipse of the moon is an actual darkening of the
moon, it is visible to anybody, wherever situated, who can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
see the moon at all; for example, to possible inhabitants
of other planets, just as we on the earth can see precisely
similar eclipses of Jupiter’s moons. An eclipse of the sun
is, however, merely the screening off of the sun’s light from
a particular observer, and the sun may therefore be eclipsed
to one observer while to another elsewhere it is visible as
usual. Hence in computing an eclipse of the sun it is
necessary to take into account the position of the observer
on the earth. The simplest way of doing this is to make
allowance for the difference of direction of the moon as
seen by an observer at the place in question, and by an
observer in some standard position on the earth, preferably
an ideal observer at the centre of the earth. If, in
fig. 31, <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> denote the moon, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> the centre of the earth,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> a point on the earth between <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> (at which therefore
the moon is overhead), and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> any other point on the earth,
then observers at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> (or <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> see the moon in slightly
different directions, <span class="smcap lowercase">C M</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B M</span>, the difference between which
is an angle known as the <b>parallax</b>, which is equal to the
angle <span class="smcap lowercase">B M C</span> and depends on the distance of the moon,
the size of the earth, and the position of the observer
at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. In the case of the sun, owing to its great distance,
even as estimated by the Greeks, the parallax was in all
cases too small to be taken into account, but in the case
of the moon the parallax might be as much as 1° and
could not be neglected.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_31"></a>
<img src="images/i_p060.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>—Parallax.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>If then the path of the moon, as seen from the centre
of the earth, were known, then the path of the moon as
seen from any particular station on the earth could be
deduced by allowing for parallax, and the conditions of
an eclipse of the sun visible there could be computed
accordingly.</p>

<p>From the time of Hipparchus onwards lunar eclipses
could easily be predicted to within an hour or two by
any ordinary astronomer; solar eclipses probably with less
accuracy; and in both cases the prediction of the extent of
the eclipse, <i>i.e.</i> of what portion of the sun or moon would
be obscured, probably left very much to be desired.</p>

<p><a id="para_44"></a>44. The great services rendered to astronomy by Hipparchus
can hardly be better expressed than in the words of
the great French historian of astronomy, Delambre, who is
in general no lenient critic of the work of his predecessors:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When we consider all that Hipparchus invented or perfected,
and reflect upon the number of his works and the mass of
calculations which they imply, we must regard him as one of
the most astonishing men of antiquity, and as the greatest of all
in the sciences which are not purely speculative, and which
require a combination of geometrical knowledge with a
knowledge of phenomena, to be observed only by diligent
attention and refined instruments.”<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_45"></a>45. For nearly three centuries after the death of Hipparchus,
the history of astronomy is almost a blank. Several
textbooks written during this period are extant, shewing
the gradual popularisation of his great discoveries. Among
the few things of interest in these books may be noticed
a statement that the stars are not necessarily on the surface
of a sphere, but may be at different distances from
us, which, however, there are no means of estimating; a
conjecture that the sun and stars are so far off that the earth
would be a mere point seen from the sun and invisible
from the stars; and a re-statement of an old opinion
traditionally attributed to the Egyptians (whether of the
Alexandrine period or earlier is uncertain), that Venus and
Mercury revolve round the sun. It seems also that in this
period some attempts were made to explain the planetary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
motions by means of epicycles, but whether these attempts
marked any advance on what had been done by Apollonius
and Hipparchus is uncertain.</p>

<p>It is interesting also to find in <i>Pliny</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 23-79) the
well-known modern argument for the spherical form of the
earth, that when a ship sails away the masts, etc., remain
visible after the hull has disappeared from view.</p>

<p>A new measurement of the circumference of the earth by
<i>Posidonius</i> (born about the end of Hipparchus’s life) may
also be noticed; he adopted a method similar to that of
Eratosthenes (<a href="#para_36">§&nbsp;36</a>), and arrived at two different results.
The later estimate, to which he seems to have attached
most weight, was 180,000 stadia, a result which was about
as much below the truth as that of Eratosthenes was
above it.</p>

<p><a id="para_46"></a>46. The last great name in Greek astronomy is that
of Claudius Ptolemaeus, commonly known as <i>Ptolemy</i>, of
whose life nothing is known except that he lived in
Alexandria about the middle of the 2nd century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
His reputation rests chiefly on his great astronomical
treatise, known as the <i>Almagest</i>,<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> which is the source
from which by far the greater part of our knowledge of
Greek astronomy is derived, and which may be fairly
regarded as the astronomical Bible of the Middle Ages.
Several other minor astronomical and astrological treatises
are attributed to him, some of which are probably not
genuine, and he was also the author of an important work
on geography, and possibly of a treatise on <i>Optics</i>, which
is, however, not certainly authentic and maybe of Arabian
origin. The <i>Optics</i> discusses, among other topics, the
<b>refraction</b> or bending of light, by the atmosphere on the
earth: it is pointed out that the light of a star or other
heavenly body <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, on entering our atmosphere (at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) and on
penetrating to the lower and denser portions of it, must
be gradually bent or <b>refracted</b>, the result being that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
star appears to the observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> nearer to the zenith <span class="smcap lowercase">Z</span>
than it actually is, <i>i.e.</i> the light appears to come from <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>
instead of from <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>; it is shewn further that this effect must
be greater for bodies near the horizon than for those near
the zenith, the light from the former travelling through
a greater extent of atmosphere; and these results are
shewn to account for certain observed deviations in the
daily paths of the stars, by which they appear unduly
raised up when near the horizon. Refraction also explains
the well-known flattened appearance of the sun or moon
when rising or setting, the lower edge being raised by
refraction more than the upper, so that a contraction of
the vertical diameter results, the horizontal contraction
being much less.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p><a id="para_47"></a>47. The <i>Almagest</i> is avowedly based largely on the work
of earlier astronomers, and in particular on that of Hipparchus,
for whom Ptolemy continually expresses the greatest
admiration and respect. Many of its contents have therefore
already been dealt with by anticipation, and need not
be discussed again in detail. The book plays, however,
such an important part in astronomical history, that it
may be worth while to give a short outline of its contents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
in addition to dealing more fully with the parts in which
Ptolemy made important advances.</p>

<p>The <i>Almagest</i> consists altogether of 13 books. The
first two deal with the simpler observed facts, such as the
daily motion of the celestial sphere, and the general
motions of the sun, moon, and planets, and also with a
number of topics connected with the celestial sphere and
its motion, such as the length of the day and the times
of rising and setting of the stars in different zones of the
earth; there are also given the solutions of some important
mathematical problems,<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and a mathematical table<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> of
considerable accuracy and extent. But the most interesting
parts of these introductory books deal with what may
be called the postulates of Ptolemy’s astronomy (Book I.,
chap. ii.). The first of these is that the earth is spherical;
Ptolemy discusses and rejects various alternative views,
and gives several of the usual positive arguments for a
spherical form, omitting, however, one of the strongest,
the eclipse argument found in Aristotle (<a href="#para_29">§&nbsp;29</a>), possibly
as being too recondite and difficult, and adding the
argument based on the increase in the area of the earth
visible when the observer ascends to a height. In his
geography he accepts the estimate given by Posidonius
that the circumference of the earth is 180,000 stadia. The
other postulates which he enunciates and for which he
argues are, that the heavens are spherical and revolve like
a sphere; that the earth is in the centre of the heavens,
and is merely a point in comparison with the distance of
the fixed stars, and that it has no motion. The position
of these postulates in the treatise and Ptolemy’s general
method of procedure suggest that he was treating them, not
so much as important results to be established by the best
possible evidence, but rather as assumptions, more probable
than any others with which the author was acquainted,
on which to base mathematical calculations which should
explain observed phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> His attitude is thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
essentially different from that either of the early Greeks,
such as Pythagoras, or of the controversialists of the 16th
and early 17th centuries, such as Galilei (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>), for
whom the truth or falsity of postulates analogous to those
of Ptolemy was of the very essence of astronomy and was
among the final objects of inquiry. The arguments which
Ptolemy produces in support of his postulates, arguments
which were probably the commonplaces of the astronomical
writing of his time, appear to us, except in the case of
the shape of the earth, loose and of no great value.
The other postulates were, in fact, scarcely, capable of
either proof or disproof with the evidence which Ptolemy
had at command. His argument in favour of the immobility
of the earth is interesting, as it shews his clear
perception that the more obvious appearances can be
explained equally well by a motion of the stars or by a
motion of the earth; he concludes, however, that it is
easier to attribute motion to bodies like the stars which
seem to be of the nature of fire than to the solid earth,
and points out also the difficulty of conceiving the earth to
have a rapid motion of which we are entirely unconscious.
He does not, however, discuss seriously the possibility that
the earth or even Venus and Mercury may revolve round
the sun.</p>

<p>The third book of the <i>Almagest</i> deals with the length of
the year and theory of the sun, but adds nothing of importance
to the work of Hipparchus.</p>

<p><a id="para_48"></a>48. The fourth book of the <i>Almagest</i>, which treats of
the length of the month and of the theory of the moon,
contains one of Ptolemy’s most important discoveries. We
have seen that, apart from the motion of the moon’s orbit
as a whole, and the revolution of the line of apses, the
chief irregularity or inequality was the so-called equation
of the centre (§§&nbsp;39, 40), represented fairly accurately by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
means of an eccentric, and depending only on the position
of the moon with respect to its apogee. Ptolemy, however,
discovered, what Hipparchus only suspected, that there
was a further inequality in the moon’s motion—to which
the name <b>evection</b> was afterwards given—and that this
depended partly on its position with respect to the sun.
Ptolemy compared the observed positions of the moon with
those calculated by Hipparchus in various positions relative
to the sun and apogee, and found that, although there was
a satisfactory agreement at new and full moon, there was a
considerable error when the moon was half-full, provided
it was also not very near perigee or apogee. Hipparchus
based his theory of the moon chiefly on observations of
eclipses, <i>i.e.</i> on observations taken necessarily at full or new
moon (<a href="#para_43">§&nbsp;43</a>), and Ptolemy’s discovery is due to the fact
that he checked Hipparchus’s theory by observations taken
at other times. To represent this new inequality, it was
found necessary to use an epicycle and a deferent, the latter
being itself a moving eccentric circle, the centre of which
revolved round the earth. To account, to some extent, for
certain remaining discrepancies between theory and observation,
which occurred neither at new and full moon, nor
at the <b>quadratures</b> (half-moon), Ptolemy introduced further
a certain small to-and-fro oscillation of the epicycle, an
oscillation to which he gave the name of <b>prosneusis</b>.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>Ptolemy thus succeeded in fitting his theory on to his
observations so well that the error seldom exceeded 10′,
a small quantity in the astronomy of the time, and on
the basis of this construction he calculated tables from
which the position of the moon at any required time could
be easily deduced.</p>

<p>One of the inherent weaknesses of the system of epicycles
occurred in this theory in an aggravated form. It
has already been noticed in connection with the theory of
the sun (<a href="#para_39">§&nbsp;39</a>), that the eccentric or epicycle produced an
erroneous variation in the distance of the sun, which was,
however, imperceptible in Greek times. Ptolemy’s system,
however, represented the moon as being sometimes nearly
twice as far off as at others, and consequently the apparent
diameter ought at some times to have been not much more
than half as great as at others—a conclusion obviously
inconsistent with observation. It seems probable that
Ptolemy noticed this difficulty, but was unable to deal with
it; it is at any rate a significant fact that when he is dealing
with eclipses, for which the apparent diameters of the sun
and moon are of importance, he entirely rejects the estimates
that might have been obtained from his lunar theory and
appeals to direct observation (cf. also §&nbsp;51, note).</p>

<p><a id="para_49"></a>49. The fifth book of the <i>Almagest</i> contains an account
of the construction and use of Ptolemy’s chief astronomical
instrument, a combination of graduated circles known as
the <b>astrolabe</b>.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>Then follows a detailed discussion of the moon’s
parallax (<a href="#para_43">§&nbsp;43</a>), and of the distances of the sun and moon.
Ptolemy obtains the distance of the moon by a parallax
method which is substantially identical with that still in use.
If we know the direction of the line <span class="smcap lowercase">C M</span> (fig. 33) joining the
centres of the earth and moon, or the direction of the
moon as seen by an observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>; and also the direction
of the line <span class="smcap lowercase">B M</span>, that is the direction of the moon as seen
by an observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, then the angles of the triangle <span class="smcap lowercase">C B M</span>
are known, and the ratio of the sides <span class="smcap lowercase">C B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C M</span> is known.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Ptolemy obtained the two directions required by means
of observations of the moon, and hence found that <span class="smcap lowercase">C M</span>
was 59 times <span class="smcap lowercase">C B</span>, or that the distance of the moon was
equal to 59 times the radius of the earth. He then uses
Hipparchus’s eclipse method to deduce the distance of the
sun from that of the moon thus ascertained, and finds
the distance of the sun to be 1,210 times the radius of
the earth. This number, which is substantially the same
as that obtained by Hipparchus (<a href="#para_41">§&nbsp;41</a>), is, however, only
about 1∕20 of the true number, as indicated by modern
work (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_284">§&nbsp;284</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_33"></a>
<img src="images/i_p068.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>—Parallax.</div>
</div>

<p>The sixth book is devoted to eclipses, and contains no
substantial additions to the work of Hipparchus.</p>

<p><a id="para_50"></a>50. The seventh and eighth books contain a catalogue of
stars, and a discussion of precession (<a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>). The catalogue,
which contains 1,028 stars (three of which are duplicates),
appears to be nearly identical with that of Hipparchus,
It contains none of the stars which were visible to Ptolemy
at Alexandria, but not to Hipparchus at Rhodes. Moreover,
Ptolemy professes to deduce from a comparison of
his observations with those of Hipparchus and others the
(erroneous) value 36″ for the precession, which Hipparchus
had given as the least possible value, and which Ptolemy
regards as his final estimate. But an examination of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
the positions assigned to the stars in Ptolemy’s catalogue
agrees better with their actual positions in the time of
Hipparchus, <i>corrected for precession at the supposed rate of
36″ annually</i>, than with their actual positions in Ptolemy’s
time. It is therefore probable that the catalogue as a
whole does not represent genuine observations made by
Ptolemy, but is substantially the catalogue of Hipparchus
corrected for precession and only occasionally modified by
new observations by Ptolemy or others.</p>

<p><a id="para_51"></a>51. The last five books deal with the theory of the
planets, the most important of Ptolemy’s original contributions
to astronomy. The problem of giving a satisfactory
explanation of the motions of the planets was, on account
of their far greater irregularity, a much more difficult one
than the corresponding problem for the sun or moon. The
motions of the latter are so nearly uniform that their
irregularities may usually be regarded as of the nature of
small corrections, and for many purposes may be ignored.
The planets, however, as we have seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_14">§&nbsp;14</a>), do
not even always move from west to east, but stop at intervals,
move in the reverse direction for a time, stop again, and
then move again in the original direction. It was probably
recognised in early times, at latest by Eudoxus (<a href="#para_26">§&nbsp;26</a>), that
in the case of three of the planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn,
these motions could be represented roughly by supposing
each planet to oscillate to and fro on each side of a fictitious
planet, moving uniformly round the celestial sphere in or
near the ecliptic, and that Venus and Mercury could
similarly be regarded as oscillating to and fro on each side
of the sun. These rough motions could easily be interpreted
by means of revolving spheres or of epicycles, as was
done by Eudoxus and probably again with more precision
by Apollonius. In the case of Jupiter, for example, we
may regard the planet as moving on an epicycle, the centre
of which, <i>j</i>, describes uniformly a deferent, the centre of
which is the earth. The planet will then as seen from the
earth appear alternately to the east (as at <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>1</sub>) and to the
west (as at <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>2</sub>) of the fictitious planet <i>j</i>; and the extent of
the oscillation on each side, and the interval between successive
appearances in the extreme positions (<span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>1</sub>, <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>2</sub>) on either
side, can be made right by choosing appropriately the size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
and rapidity of motion of the epicycle. It is moreover
evident that with this arrangement the apparent motion
of Jupiter will vary considerably, as the two motions—that
on the epicycle and that of the centre of the epicycle on
the deferent—are sometimes in the same direction, so as
to increase one another’s effect, and at other times in
opposite directions. Thus, when Jupiter is most distant
from the earth, that is at <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>3</sub>, the motion is most rapid, at
<span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>2</sub> the motion as seen from the earth is nearly the
same as that of <i>j</i>; while at <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>4</sub> the two motions are in
opposite directions, and the
size and motion of the epicycle
having been chosen in
the way indicated above,
it is found in fact that the
motion of the planet in the
epicycle is the greater of the
two motions, and that therefore
the planet when in
this position appears to be
moving from east to west
(from left to right in the
figure), as is actually the
case. As then at <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>1</sub> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>2</sub> the planet appears to
be moving from west to
east, and at <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>4</sub> in the opposite direction, and sudden
changes of motion do not occur in astronomy, there must
be a position between <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>1</sub> and <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>4</sub>, and another between
<span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>4</sub> and <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span><sub>2</sub>, at which the planet is just reversing its direction
of motion, and therefore appears for the instant at rest.
We thus arrive at an explanation of the stationary points
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_14">§&nbsp;14</a>). An exactly similar scheme explains
roughly the motion of Mercury and Venus, except that
the centre of the epicycle must always be in the direction
of the sun.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>—Jupiter’s epicycle
and deferent.</div>
</div>

<p>Hipparchus, as we have seen (<a href="#para_41">§&nbsp;41</a>), found the current
representations of the planetary motions inaccurate, and
collected a number of fresh observations. These, with
fresh observations of his own, Ptolemy now employed
in order to construct an improved planetary system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>As in the case of the moon, he used as deferent an
eccentric circle (centre <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>), but instead of making the
centre <i>j</i> of the epicycle move uniformly in the deferent, he
introduced a new point called an <b>equant</b> (<span class="smcap lowercase">E′</span>), situated at
the same distance from the centre of the deferent as the
earth but on the opposite side, and regulated the motion of
<i>j</i> by the condition that the apparent motion <i>as seen from the
equant</i> should be uniform; in other words, the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A E′</span> <i>j</i>
was made to increase uniformly. In the case of Mercury
(the motions of which have been found troublesome by
astronomers of all periods),
the relation of the equant to
the centre of the epicycle was
different, and the latter was
made to move in a small
circle. The deviations of the
planets from the ecliptic
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_13">§§&nbsp;13</a>, 14) were
accounted for by tilting up
the planes of the several
deferents and epicycles so
that they were inclined to the
ecliptic at various small angles.</p>

<a id="Fig_35"></a>
<img src="images/i_p071.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—The equant.</div>
</div>

<p>By means of a system of this
kind, worked out with great
care, and evidently at the cost of enormous labour, Ptolemy
was able to represent with very fair exactitude the motions
of the planets, as given by the observations in his possession.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by modern critics, as well as by
some mediaeval writers, that the use of the equant (which
played also a small part in Ptolemy’s lunar theory) was a
violation of the principle of employing only uniform circular
motions, on which the systems of Hipparchus and Ptolemy
were supposed to be based, and that Ptolemy himself
appeared unconscious of his inconsistency. It may, however,
fairly be doubted whether Hipparchus or Ptolemy
ever had an abstract belief in the exclusive virtue of such
motions, except as a convenient and easily intelligible
way of representing certain more complicated motions,
and it is difficult to conceive that Hipparchus would have
scrupled any more than his great follower, in using an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
equant to represent an irregular motion, if he had found
that the motion was thereby represented with accuracy.
The criticism appears to me in fact to be an anachronism.
The earlier Greeks, whose astronomy was speculative rather
than scientific, and again many astronomers of the Middle
Ages, felt that it was on <i>a priori</i> grounds necessary to represent
the “perfection” of the heavenly motions by the
most “perfect” or regular of geometrical schemes; so that
it is highly probable that Pythagoras or Plato, or even
Aristotle, would have objected, and certain that the
astronomers of the 14th and 15th centuries ought to have
objected (as some of them actually did), to this innovation
of Ptolemy’s. But there seems no good reason for
attributing this <i>a priori</i> attitude to the later scientific Greek
astronomers (cf. also <a href="#para_38">§§&nbsp;38</a>, 47).<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>It will be noticed that nothing has been said as to the
actual distances of the planets, and in fact the apparent
motions are unaffected by any alteration in the scale on
which deferent and epicycle are constructed, provided that
both are altered proportionally. Ptolemy expressly states that
he had no means of estimating numerically the distances of
the planets, or even of knowing the order of the distance of
the several planets. He followed tradition in accepting
conjecturally rapidity of motion as a test of nearness, and
placed Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (which perform the circuit
of the celestial sphere in about 2, 12, and 29 years respectively)
beyond the sun in that order. As Venus and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Mercury accompany the sun, and may therefore be regarded
as on the average performing their revolutions in a year,
the test to some extent failed in their case, but Ptolemy
again accepted the opinion of the “ancient mathematicians”
(<i>i.e.</i> probably the Chaldaeans) that Mercury and Venus lie
between the sun and moon, Mercury being the nearer to
us. (Cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, §&nbsp;15.)</p>

<p><a id="para_52"></a>52. There has been much difference of opinion among
astronomers as to the merits of Ptolemy. Throughout the
Middle Ages his authority was regarded as almost final on
astronomical matters, except where it was outweighed by
the even greater authority assigned to Aristotle. Modern
criticism has made clear, a fact which indeed he never
conceals, that his work is to a large extent based on that
of Hipparchus; and that his observations, if not actually
fictitious, were at any rate in most cases poor. On the
other hand his work shews clearly that he was an accomplished
and original mathematician.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The most important
of his positive contributions to astronomy were the discovery
of evection and his planetary theory, but we ought probably
to rank above these, important as they are, the services
which he rendered by preserving and developing the great
ideas of Hipparchus—ideas which the other astronomers
of the time were probably incapable of appreciating, and
which might easily have been lost to us if they had not
been embodied in the <i>Almagest</i>.</p>

<p><a id="para_53"></a>53. The history of Greek astronomy practically ceases
with Ptolemy. The practice of observation died out so
completely that only eight observations are known to have
been made during the eight and a half centuries which
separate him from Albategnius (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_59">§&nbsp;59</a>). The
only Greek writers after Ptolemy’s time are compilers and
commentators, such as <i>Theon</i> (<i>fl.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 365), to none of
whom original ideas of any importance can be attributed.
The murder of his daughter Hypatia (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 415), herself
also a writer on astronomy, marks an epoch in the decay
of the Alexandrine school; and the end came in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 640,
when Alexandria was captured by the Arabs.<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p><a id="para_54"></a>54. It remains to attempt to estimate briefly the value of
the contributions to astronomy made by the Greeks and of
their method of investigation. It is obviously unreasonable
to expect to find a brief formula which will characterise the
scientific attitude of a series of astronomers whose lives
extend over a period of eight centuries; and it is futile
to explain the inferiority of Greek astronomy to our own on
some such ground as that they had not discovered the method
of induction, that they were not careful enough to obtain
facts, or even that their ideas were not clear. In habits
of thought and scientific aims the contrast between Pythagoras
and Hipparchus is probably greater than that between
Hipparchus on the one hand and Coppernicus or even
Newton on the other, while it is not unfair to say that the
fanciful ideas which pervade the work of even so great a
discoverer as Kepler (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_144">§§&nbsp;144</a>, 151) place his
scientific method in some respects behind that of his great
Greek predecessor.</p>

<p>The Greeks inherited from their predecessors a number
of observations, many of them executed with considerable
accuracy, which were nearly sufficient for the requirements
of practical life, but in the matter of astronomical theory
and speculation, in which their best thinkers were very
much more interested than in the detailed facts, they
received virtually a blank sheet on which they had to write
(at first with indifferent success) their speculative ideas.
A considerable interval of time was obviously necessary to
bridge over the gulf separating such data as the eclipse
observations of the Chaldaeans from such ideas as the
harmonical spheres of Pythagoras; and the necessary
theoretical structure could not be erected without the use
of mathematical methods which had gradually to be invented.
That the Greeks, particularly in early times, paid
little attention to making observations, is true enough, but
it may fairly be doubted whether the collection of fresh
material for observations would really have carried
astronomy much beyond the point reached by the
Chaldaean observers. When once speculative ideas, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
definite by the aid of geometry, had been sufficiently
developed to be capable of comparison with observation,
rapid progress was made. The Greek astronomers of the
scientific period, such as Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, and
above all Hipparchus, appear moreover to have followed
in their researches the method which has always been
fruitful in physical science—namely, to frame provisional
hypotheses, to deduce their mathematical consequences,
and to compare these with the results of observation.
There are few better illustrations of genuine scientific
caution than the way in which Hipparchus, having tested
the planetary theories handed down to him and having
discovered their insufficiency, deliberately abstained from
building up a new theory on data which he knew to be
insufficient, and patiently collected fresh material, never to
be used by himself, that some future astronomer might
thereby be able to arrive at an improved theory.</p>

<p>Of positive additions to our astronomical knowledge
made by the Greeks the most striking in some ways is the
discovery of the approximately spherical form of the earth,
a result which later work has only slightly modified. But
their explanation of the chief motions of the solar system
and their resolution of them into a comparatively small
number of simpler motions was, in reality, a far more important
contribution, though the Greek epicyclic scheme
has been so remodelled, that at first sight it is difficult to
recognise the relation between it and our modern views.
The subsequent history will, however, show how completely
each stage in the progress of astronomical science has
depended on those that preceded.</p>

<p>When we study the great conflict in the time of Coppernicus
between the ancient and modern ideas, our sympathies
naturally go out towards those who supported the latter,
which are now known to be more accurate, and we are apt to
forget that those who then spoke in the name of the ancient
astronomy and quoted Ptolemy were indeed believers in
the doctrines which they had derived from the Greeks, but
that their methods of thought, their frequent refusal to face
facts, and their appeals to authority, were all entirely
foreign to the spirit of the great men whose disciples they
believed themselves to be.</p>

<p><a id="para_55"></a>55. About fourteen centuries elapsed between the publication
of the <i>Almagest</i> and the death of Coppernicus (1543),
a date which is in astronomy a convenient landmark on the
boundary between the Middle Ages and the modern world.
In this period, nearly twice as long as that which separated
Thales from Ptolemy, almost four times as long as that
which has now elapsed since the death of Coppernicus, no
astronomical discovery of first-rate importance was made.
There were some important advances in mathematics, and
the art of observation was improved; but theoretical
astronomy made scarcely any progress, and in some respects
even went backward, the current doctrines, if in some
points slightly more correct than those of Ptolemy, being
less intelligently held.</p>

<p>In the Western World we have already seen that there
was little to record for nearly five centuries after Ptolemy.
After that time ensued an almost total blank, and several
more centuries elapsed before there was any appreciable
revival of the interest once felt in astronomy.</p>

<p><a id="para_56"></a>56. Meanwhile a remarkable development of science had
taken place in the East during the 7th century. The
descendants of the wild Arabs who had carried the banner
of Mahomet over so large a part of the Roman empire, as
well as over lands lying farther east, soon began to feel the
influence of the civilisation of the peoples whom they had
subjugated, and Bagdad, which in the 8th century became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the capital of the Caliphs, rapidly developed into a centre of
literary and scientific activity. Al Mansur, who reigned
from <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 754 to 775, was noted as a patron of science,
and collected round him learned men both from India and
the West. In particular we are told of the arrival at his
court in 772 of a scholar from India bearing with him an
Indian treatise on astronomy,<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> which was translated into
Arabic by order of the Caliph, and remained the standard
treatise for nearly half a century. From Al Mansur’s time
onwards a body of scholars, in the first instance chiefly
Syrian Christians, were at work at the court of the Caliphs
translating Greek writings, often through the medium of
Syriac, into Arabic. The first translations made were of
the medical treatises of Hippocrates and Galen; the
Aristotelian ideas contained in the latter appear to have
stimulated interest in the writings of Aristotle himself, and
thus to have enlarged the range of subjects regarded as
worthy of study. Astronomy soon followed medicine, and
became the favourite science of the Arabians, partly no doubt
out of genuine scientific interest, but probably still more for
the sake of its practical applications. Certain Mahometan
ceremonial observances required a knowledge of the
direction of Mecca, and though many worshippers, living
anywhere between the Indus and the Straits of Gibraltar,
must have satisfied themselves with rough-and-ready
solutions of this problem, the assistance which astronomy
could give in fixing the true direction was welcome in
larger centres of population. The Mahometan calendar,
a lunar one, also required some attention in order that
fasts and feasts should be kept at the proper times. Moreover
the belief in the possibility of predicting the future
by means of the stars, which had flourished among the
Chaldaeans (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_18">§&nbsp;18</a>), but which remained to a great
extent in abeyance among the Greeks, now revived rapidly
on a congenial oriental soil, and the Caliphs were probably
quite as much interested in seeing that the learned men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
their courts were proficient in astrology as in astronomy
proper.</p>

<p>The first translation of the <i>Almagest</i> was made by order
of Al Mansur’s successor Harun al Rasid (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 765 or 766-<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
809), the hero of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. It seems,
however, to have been found difficult to translate; fresh
attempts were made by <i>Honein ben Ishak</i> (?-873) and
by his son <i>Ishak ben Honein</i> (?-910 or 911), and a final
version by <i>Tabit ben Korra</i> (836-901) appeared towards
the end of the 9th century. Ishak ben Honein translated
also a number of other astronomical and mathematical
books, so that by the end of the 9th century, after which
translations almost ceased, most of the more important
Greek books on these subjects, as well as many minor
treatises, had been translated. To this activity we owe
our knowledge of several books of which the Greek originals
have perished.</p>

<p><a id="para_57"></a>57. During the period in which the Caliphs lived at
Damascus an observatory was erected there, and another on
a more magnificent scale was built at Bagdad in 829 by the
Caliph Al Mamun. The instruments used were superior both
in size and in workmanship to those of the Greeks, though
substantially of the same type. The Arab astronomers
introduced moreover the excellent practice of making
regular and as far as possible nearly continuous observations
of the chief heavenly bodies, as well as the custom
of noting the positions of known stars at the beginning
and end of an eclipse, so as to have afterwards an exact
record of the times of their occurrence. So much importance
was attached to correct observations that we are told
that those of special interest were recorded in formal
documents signed on oath by a mixed body of astronomers
and lawyers.</p>

<p>Al Mamun ordered Ptolemy’s estimate of the size of the
earth to be verified by his astronomers. Two separate
measurements of a portion of a meridian were made, which,
however, agreed so closely with one another and with
the erroneous estimate of Ptolemy that they can hardly
have been independent and careful measurements, but
rather rough verifications of Ptolemy’s figures.</p>

<p><a id="para_58"></a>58. The careful observations of the Arabs soon shewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the defects in the Greek astronomical tables, and new tables
were from time to time issued, based on much the same
principles as those in the <i>Almagest</i>, but with changes in
such numerical data as the relative sizes of the various
circles, the positions of the apogees, and the inclinations
of the planes, etc.</p>

<p>To Tabit ben Korra, mentioned above as the translator of
the <i>Almagest</i>, belongs the doubtful honour of the discovery
of a supposed variation in the amount of the precession
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_42">§§&nbsp;42</a>, 50). To account for this he devised a
complicated mechanism which produced a certain alteration
in the position of the ecliptic, thus introducing a purely
imaginary complication, known as the <b>trepidation</b>, which
confused and obscured most of the astronomical tables
issued during the next five or six centuries.</p>

<p><a id="para_59"></a>59. A far greater astronomer than any of those mentioned
in the preceding articles was the Arab prince called
from his birthplace Al Battani, and better known by the
Latinised name <i>Albategnius</i>, who carried on observations
from 878 to 918 and died in 929. He tested many of
Ptolemy’s results by fresh observations, and obtained
more accurate values of the obliquity of the ecliptic
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_11">§&nbsp;11</a>) and of precession. He wrote also a
treatise on astronomy which contained improved tables
of the sun and moon, and included his most notable discovery—namely,
that the direction of the point in the
sun’s orbit at which it is farthest from the earth (the
apogee), or, in other words, the direction of the centre of
the eccentric representing the sun’s motion (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>,
<a href="#para_39">§&nbsp;39</a>), was not the same as that given in the <i>Almagest</i>;
from which change, too great to be attributed to mere
errors of observation or calculation, it might fairly be
inferred that the apogee was slowly moving, a result which,
however, he did not explicitly state. Albategnius was also
a good mathematician, and the author of some notable
improvements in methods of calculation.<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p><a id="para_60"></a>60. The last of the Bagdad astronomers was <i>Abul Wafa</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
(939 or 940-998), the author of a voluminous treatise on
astronomy also known as the <i>Almagest</i>, which contained
some new ideas and was written on a different plan from
Ptolemy’s book, of which it has sometimes been supposed
to be a translation. In discussing the theory of the moon
Abul Wafa found that, after allowing for the equation of
the centre and for the evection, there remained a further
irregularity in the moon’s motion which was imperceptible
at conjunction, opposition, and quadrature, but appreciable
at the intermediate points. It is possible that Abul Wafa
here detected an inequality rediscovered by Tycho Brahe
(chapter <i>V.</i>, <a href="#para_111">§&nbsp;111</a>) and known as the <b>variation</b>, but it
is equally likely that he was merely restating Ptolemy’s
prosneusis (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_48">§&nbsp;48</a>).<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> In either case Abul Wafa’s
discovery appears to have been entirely ignored by his
successors and to have borne no fruit. He also carried
further some of the mathematical improvements of his
predecessors.</p>

<p>Another nearly contemporary astronomer, commonly
known as <i>Ibn Yunos</i> (?-1008), worked at Cairo under
the patronage of the Mahometan rulers of Egypt. He
published a set of astronomical and mathematical tables,
the <i>Hakemite Tables</i>, which remained the standard ones for
about two centuries, and he embodied in the same book
a number of his own observations as well as an extensive
series by earlier Arabian astronomers.</p>

<p><a id="para_61"></a>61. About this time astronomy, in common with other
branches of knowledge, had made some progress in the
Mahometan dominions in Spain and the opposite coast
of Africa. A great library and an academy were founded
at Cordova about 970, and centres of education and learning
were established in rapid succession at Cordova, Toledo,
Seville, and Morocco.</p>

<p>The most important work produced by the astronomers
of these places was the volume of astronomical tables
published under the direction of <i>Arzachel</i> in 1080, and
known as the <i>Toletan Tables</i>, because calculated for an
observer at Toledo, where Arzachel probably lived. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the same school are due some improvements in instruments
and in methods of calculation, and several writings
were published in criticism of Ptolemy, without, however,
suggesting any improvements on his ideas.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, the Spanish Christians began to drive
back their Mahometan neighbours. Cordova and Seville
were captured in 1236 and 1248 respectively, and with their
fall Arab astronomy disappeared from history.</p>

<p><a id="para_62"></a>62. Before we pass on to consider the progress of
astronomy in Europe, two more astronomical schools of
the East deserve mention, both of which illustrate an
extraordinarily rapid growth of scientific interests among
barbarous peoples. Hulagu Khan, a grandson of the
Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan, captured Bagdad in 1258
and ended the rule of the Caliphs there. Some years
before this he had received into favour, partly as a political
adviser, the astronomer <i>Nassir Eddin</i> (born in 1201 at Tus
in Khorassan), and subsequently provided funds for the
establishment of a magnificent observatory at Meraga, near
the north-west frontier of modern Persia. Here a number
of astronomers worked under the general superintendence
of Nassir Eddin. The instruments they used were remarkable
for their size and careful construction, and were
probably better than any used in Europe in the time of
Coppernicus, being surpassed first by those of Tycho Brahe
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>).</p>

<p>Nassir Eddin and his assistants translated or commented
on nearly all the more important available Greek writings
on astronomy and allied subjects, including Euclid’s
<i>Elements</i>, several books by Archimedes, and the <i>Almagest</i>.
Nassir Eddin also wrote an abstract of astronomy, marked
by some little originality, and a treatise on geometry. He
does not appear to have accepted the authority of Ptolemy
without question, and objected in particular to the use
of the equant (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_51">§&nbsp;51</a>), which he replaced by
a new combination of spheres. Many of these treatises
had for a long time a great reputation in the East, and
became in their turn the subject-matter of commentary.</p>

<p>But the great work of the Meraga astronomers, which
occupied them 12 years, was the issue of a revised set of
astronomical tables, based on the Hakemite Tables of Ibn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Yunos (<a href="#para_60">§&nbsp;60</a>), and called in honour of their patron the
<i>Ilkhanic Tables</i>. They contained not only the usual tables
for computing the motions of the planets, etc., but also a
star catalogue, based to some extent on new observations.</p>

<p>An important result of the observations of fixed stars
made at Meraga was that the precession (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>)
was fixed at 51″, or within about 1″ of its true value. Nassir
Eddin also discussed the supposed trepidation (<a href="#para_58">§&nbsp;58</a>), but
seems to have been a little doubtful of its reality. He died
in 1273, soon after his patron, and with him the Meraga
School came to an end as rapidly as it was formed.</p>

<p><a id="para_63"></a>63. Nearly two centuries later <i>Ulugh Begh</i> (born in 1394),
a grandson of the savage Tartar Tamerlane, developed a
great personal interest in astronomy, and built about 1420 an
observatory at Samarcand (in the present Russian Turkestan),
where he worked with assistants. He published fresh
tables of the planets, etc., but his most important work
was a star catalogue, embracing nearly the same stars as
that of Ptolemy, but observed afresh. This was probably
the first substantially independent catalogue made since
Hipparchus. The places of the stars were given with
unusual precision, the minutes as well as the degrees
of celestial longitude and latitude being recorded; and
although a comparison with modern observation shews
that there were usually errors of several minutes, it is
probable that the instruments used were extremely good.
Ulugh Begh was murdered by his son in 1449, and with
him Tartar astronomy ceased.</p>

<p><a id="para_64"></a>64. No great original idea can be attributed to any of the
Arab and other astronomers whose work we have sketched.
They had, however, a remarkable aptitude for absorbing
foreign ideas, and carrying them slightly further. They
were patient and accurate observers, and skilful calculators.
We owe to them a long series of observations, and the
invention or introduction of several important improvements
in mathematical methods.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Among the most
important of their services to mathematics, and hence to
astronomy, must be counted the introduction, from India,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of our present system of writing numbers, by which the
value of a numeral is altered by its position, and fresh
symbols are not wanted, as in the clumsy Greek and
Roman systems, for higher numbers. An immense simplification
was thereby introduced into arithmetical work.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
More important than the actual original contributions of
the Arabs to astronomy was the service that they performed
in keeping alive interest in the science and preserving the
discoveries of their Greek predecessors.</p>

<p>Some curious relics of the time when the Arabs were
the great masters in astronomy have been preserved in
astronomical language. Thus we have derived from them,
usually in very corrupt forms, the current names of many
individual stars, <i>e.g.</i> Aldebaran, Altair, Betelgeux, Rigel,
Vega (the constellations being mostly known by Latin
translations of the Greek names), and some common
astronomical terms such as zenith and <b>nadir</b> (the invisible
point on the celestial sphere opposite the zenith); while
at least one such word, almanack, has passed into common
language.</p>

<p><a id="para_65"></a>65. In Europe the period of confusion following the breakup
of the Roman empire and preceding the definite formation
of feudal Europe is almost a blank as regards astronomy,
or indeed any other natural science. The best intellects
that were not absorbed in practical life were occupied
with theology. A few men, such as the Venerable Bede
(672-735), living for the most part in secluded monasteries,
were noted for their learning, which included in general
some portions of mathematics and astronomy; none were
noted for their additions to scientific knowledge. Some
advance was made by Charlemagne (742-814), who, in
addition to introducing something like order into his
extensive dominions, made energetic attempts to develop
education and learning. In 782 he summoned to his court
our learned countryman <i>Alcuin</i> (735-804) to give instruction
in astronomy, arithmetic, and rhetoric, as well as in other
subjects, and invited other scholars to join him, forming
thus a kind of Academy of which Alcuin was the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>Charlemagne not only founded a higher school at his
own court, but was also successful in urging the ecclesiastical
authorities in all parts of his dominions to do
the same. In these schools were taught the seven liberal
arts, divided into the so-called trivium (grammar, rhetoric,
and dialectic) and quadrivium, which included astronomy
in addition to arithmetic, geometry, and music.</p>

<p><a id="para_66"></a>66. In the 10th century the fame of the Arab learning
began slowly to spread through Spain into other parts of
Europe, and the immense learning of <i>Gerbert</i>, the most
famous scholar of the century, who occupied the papal
chair as Sylvester II. from 999 to 1003, was attributed in
large part to the time which he spent in Spain, either in
or near the Moorish dominions. He was an ardent student,
indefatigable in collecting and reading rare books, and
was especially interested in mathematics and astronomy.
His skill in making astrolabes (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_49">§&nbsp;49</a>) and other
instruments was such that he was popularly supposed to
have acquired his powers by selling his soul to the Evil
One. Other scholars shewed a similar interest in Arabic
learning, but it was not till the lapse of another century
that the Mahometan influence became important.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 12th century began a series of
translations from Arabic into Latin of scientific and
philosophic treatises, partly original works of the Arabs,
partly Arabic translations of the Greek books. One of the
most active of the translators was <i>Plato of Tivoli</i>, who
studied Arabic in Spain about it 1116, and translated Albategnius’s
<i>Astronomy</i> (<a href="#para_59">§&nbsp;59</a>), as well as other astronomical
books. At about the same time Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>, among
other books, was translated by <i>Athelard of Bath</i>. <i>Gherardo
of Cremona</i> (1114-1187) was even more industrious, and
is said to have made translations of about 70 scientific
treatises, including the <i>Almagest</i>, and the <i>Toletan Tables</i>
of Arzachel (<a href="#para_61">§&nbsp;61</a>). The beginning of the 13th century was
marked by the foundation of several Universities, and at
that of Naples (founded in 1224) the Emperor Frederick II.,
who had come into contact with the Mahometan learning
in Sicily, gathered together a number of scholars whom he
directed to make a fresh series of translations from the
Arabic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>Aristotle’s writings on logic had been preserved in
Latin translations from classical times, and were already
much esteemed by the scholars of the 11th and 12th
centuries. His other writings were first met with in Arabic
versions, and were translated into Latin during the end
of the 12th and during the 13th centuries; in one or two
cases translations were also made from the original Greek.
The influence of Aristotle over mediæval thought, already
considerable, soon became almost supreme, and his works
were by many scholars regarded with a reverence equal to
or greater than that felt for the Christian Fathers.</p>

<p>Western knowledge of Arab astronomy was very much
increased by the activity of <i>Alfonso X.</i> of Leon and Castile
(1223-1284), who collected at Toledo, a recent conquest
from the Arabs, a body of scholars, Jews and Christians,
who calculated under his general superintendence a set of
new astronomical tables to supersede the <i>Toletan Tables</i>.
These <i>Alfonsine Tables</i> were published in 1252, on the
day of Alfonso’s accession, and spread rapidly through
Europe. They embodied no new ideas, but several
numerical data, notably the length of the year, were
given with greater accuracy than before. To Alfonso is
due also the publication of the <i>Libros del Saber</i>, a voluminous
encyclopædia of the astronomical knowledge of
the time, which, though compiled largely from Arab sources,
was not, as has sometimes been thought, a mere collection
of translations. One of the curiosities in this book is a
diagram representing Mercury’s orbit as an ellipse, the
earth being in the <i>centre</i> (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_140">§&nbsp;140</a>), this
being probably the first trace of the idea of representing
the celestial motions by means of curves other than circles.</p>

<p><a id="para_67"></a>67. To the 13th century belong also several of the great
scholars, such as <i>Albertus Magnus</i>, <i>Roger Bacon</i>, and
<i>Cecco d’ Ascoli</i> (from whom Dante learnt), who took all
knowledge for their province. Roger Bacon, who was born
in Somersetshire about 1214 and died about 1294, wrote
three principal books, called respectively the <i>Opus Majus</i>,
<i>Opus Minus</i>, and <i>Opus Tertium</i>, which contained not only
treatises on most existing branches of knowledge, but also
some extremely interesting discussions of their relative
importance and of the right method for the advancement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
of learning. He inveighs warmly against excessive adherence
to authority, especially to that of Aristotle, whose
books he wishes burnt, and speaks strongly of the importance
of experiment and of mathematical reasoning in
scientific inquiries. He evidently had a good knowledge
of optics and has been supposed to have been acquainted
with the telescope, a supposition which we can hardly
regard as confirmed by his story that the invention was
known to Caesar, who when about to invade Britain surveyed
the new country from the opposite shores of Gaul
with a telescope!</p>

<p>Another famous book of this period was written by the
Yorkshireman John Halifax or Holywood, better known
by his Latinised name <i>Sacrobosco</i>, who was for some time
a well-known teacher of mathematics at Paris, where he
died about 1256. His <i>Sphaera Mundi</i> as an elementary
treatise on the easier parts of current astronomy, dealing
in fact with little but the more obvious results of the
daily motion of the celestial sphere. It enjoyed immense
popularity for three or four centuries, and was frequently
re-edited, translated, and commented on: it was one of
the very first astronomical books ever printed; 25 editions
appeared between 1472 and the end of the century, and
40 more by the middle of the 17th century.</p>

<p><a id="para_68"></a>68. The European writers of the Middle Ages whom we
have hitherto mentioned, with the exception of Alfonso and
his assistants, had contented themselves with collecting and
rearranging such portions of the astronomical knowledge
of the Greeks and Arabs as they could master; there were
no serious attempts at making progress, and no observations
of importance were made. A new school, however, grew
up in Germany during the 15th century which succeeded
in making some additions to knowledge, not in themselves
of first-rate importance, but significant of the greater independence
that was beginning to inspire scientific work.
<i>George Purbach</i>, born in 1423, became in 1450 professor
of astronomy and mathematics at the University of Vienna,
which had soon after its foundation (1365) become a
centre for these subjects. He there began an <i>Epitome
of Astronomy</i> based on the <i>Almagest</i>, and also a Latin
version of Ptolemy’s planetary theory, intended partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
as a supplement to Sacrobosco’s textbook, from which
this part of the subject had been omitted, but in part
also as a treatise of a higher order; but he was hindered
in both undertakings by the badness of the only available
versions of the <i>Almagest</i>—Latin translations which had
been made not directly from the Greek, but through
the medium at any rate of Arabic and very possibly of
Syriac as well (cf. <a href="#para_56">§&nbsp;56</a>), and which consequently swarmed
with mistakes. He was assisted in this work by his more
famous pupil John Müller of Königsberg (in Franconia),
hence known as <i>Regiomontanus</i>, who was attracted to
Vienna at the age of 16 (1452) by Purbach’s reputation.
The two astronomers made some observations, and were
strengthened in their conviction of the necessity of astronomical
reforms by the serious inaccuracies which they
discovered in the <i>Alfonsine Tables</i>, now two centuries old;
an eclipse of the moon, for example, occurring an hour late
and Mars being seen 2° from its calculated place. Purbach
and Regiomontanus were invited to Rome by one of the
Cardinals, largely with a view to studying a copy of the
<i>Almagest</i> contained among the Greek manuscripts which
since the fall of Constantinople (1453) had come into Italy
in considerable numbers, and they were on the point of
starting when the elder man suddenly died (1461).</p>

<p>Regiomontanus, who decided on going notwithstanding
Purbach’s death, was altogether seven years in Italy; he
there acquired a good knowledge of Greek, which he had
already begun to study in Vienna, and was thus able to read
the <i>Almagest</i> and other treatises in the original; he completed
Purbach’s <i>Epitome of Astronomy</i>, made some observations,
lectured, wrote a mathematical treatise<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> of considerable
merit, and finally returned to Vienna in 1468 with originals
or copies of several important Greek manuscripts. He
was for a short time professor there, but then accepted an
invitation from the King of Hungary to arrange a valuable
collection of Greek manuscripts. The king, however, soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
turned his attention from Greek to fighting, and Regiomontanus
moved once more, settling this time in Nürnberg, then
one of the most flourishing cities in Germany, a special
attraction of which was that one of the early printing
presses was established there. The Nürnberg citizens
received Regiomontanus with great honour, and one rich
man in particular, <i>Bernard Walther</i> (1430-1504), not only
supplied him with funds, but, though an older man, became
his pupil and worked with him. The skilled artisans of
Nürnberg were employed in constructing astronomical
instruments of an accuracy hitherto unknown in Europe,
though probably still inferior to those of Nassir Eddin and
Ulugh Begh (§§&nbsp;62, 63). A number of observations were
made, among the most interesting being those of the comet
of 1472, the first comet which appears to have been
regarded as a subject for scientific study rather than for
superstitious terror. Regiomontanus recognised at once the
importance for his work of the new invention of printing,
and, finding probably that the existing presses were unable
to meet the special requirements of astronomy, started a
printing press of his own. Here he brought out in 1472
or 1473 an edition of Purbach’s book on planetary theory,
which soon became popular and was frequently reprinted.
This book indicates clearly the discrepancy already being
felt between the views of Aristotle and those of Ptolemy.
Aristotle’s original view was that sun, moon, the five
planets, and the fixed stars were attached respectively to
eight spheres, one inside the other; and that the outer
one, which contained the fixed stars, by its revolution was
the primary cause of the apparent daily motion of all the
celestial bodies. The discovery of precession required on
the part of those who carried on the Aristotelian tradition
the addition of another sphere. According to this scheme,
which was probably due to some of the translators or
commentators at Bagdad (<a href="#para_56">§&nbsp;56</a>), the fixed stars were on
a sphere, often called the <b>firmament</b>, and outside this was
a ninth sphere, known as the <b>primum mobile</b>, which moved
all the others; another sphere was added by Tabit ben
Korra to account for trepidation (<a href="#para_58">§&nbsp;58</a>), and accepted by
Alfonso and his school; an eleventh sphere was added
towards the end of the Middle Ages to account for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
supposed changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic. A few
writers invented a larger number. Outside these spheres
mediaeval thought usually placed the Empyrean or Heaven.
The accompanying diagram illustrates the whole arrangement.</p>

<p>These spheres, which were almost entirely fanciful and
in no serious way even professed to account for the details
of the celestial motions, are of course quite different from
the circles known as deferents and epicycles, which Hipparchus
and Ptolemy used. These were mere geometrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
abstractions, which enabled the planetary motions to be
represented with tolerable accuracy. Each planet moved
freely in space, its motion being represented or described
(not <i>controlled</i>) by a particular geometrical arrangement
of circles. Purbach suggested a compromise by hollowing
out Aristotle’s crystal spheres till there was room for
Ptolemy’s epicycles inside!</p>

<p>From the new Nürnberg press were issued also a succession
of almanacks which, like those of to-day, gave the
public useful information about moveable feasts, the phases
of the moon, eclipses, etc.; and, in addition, a volume of
less popular <i>Ephemerides</i>, with astronomical information
of a fuller and more exact character for a period of about
30 years. This contained, among other things, astronomical
data for finding latitude and longitude at sea, for which
Regiomontanus had invented a new method.<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The superiority of these tables over any others available
was such that they were used on several of the great voyages
of discovery of this period, probably by Columbus himself
on his first voyage to America.</p>

<p>In 1475 Regiomontanus was invited to Rome by the
Pope to assist in a reform of the calendar, but died there
the next year at the early age of forty.</p>

<p>Walther carried on his friend’s work and took a number
of good observations; he was the first to make any
successful attempt to allow for the atmospheric refraction
of which Ptolemy had probably had some knowledge (chapter
<span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_46">§&nbsp;46</a>); to him is due also the practice of obtaining
the position of the sun by comparison with Venus instead of
with the moon (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_39">§&nbsp;39</a>), the much slower motion
of the planet rendering greater accuracy possible.</p>

<p>After Walther’s death other observers of less merit carried
on the work, and a Nürnberg astronomical school of some
kind lasted into the 17th century.</p>

<p><a id="para_69"></a>69. A few minor discoveries in astronomy belong to this
or to a slightly later period and may conveniently be dealt
with here.</p>

<p><i>Leonardo da Vinci</i> (1452-1519), who was not only a
great painter and sculptor, but also an anatomist, engineer,
mechanician, physicist, and mathematician, was the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
to explain correctly the dim illumination seen over the
rest of the surface of the moon when the bright part is
only a thin crescent. He pointed out that when the
moon was nearly new the half of the earth which was
then illuminated by the sun was turned nearly directly
towards the moon, and that the moon was in consequence
illuminated slightly by this <b>earthshine</b>, just as we are by
moonshine. The explanation is interesting in itself, and
was also of some value as shewing an analogy between
the earth and moon which tended to break down the
supposed barrier between terrestrial and celestial bodies
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_119">§&nbsp;119</a>).</p>

<p><i>Jerome Fracastor</i> (1483-1543) and <i>Peter Apian</i> (1495-1552),
two voluminous writers on astronomy, made observations
of comets of some interest, both noticing that
a comet’s tail continually points away from the sun, as
the comet changes its position, a fact which has been
used in modern times to throw some light on the structure
of comets (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_304">§&nbsp;304</a>).</p>

<p><i>Peter Nonius</i> (1492-1577) deserves mention on account
of the knowledge of twilight which he possessed; several
problems as to the duration of twilight, its variation in
different latitudes, etc., were correctly solved by him; but
otherwise his numerous books are of no great interest.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>A new determination of the size of the earth, the first
since the time of the Caliph Al Mamun (<a href="#para_57">§&nbsp;57</a>), was made
about 1528 by the French doctor <i>John Fernel</i> (1497-1558),
who arrived at a result the error in which (less than 1 per
cent.) was far less than could reasonably have been expected
from the rough methods employed.</p>

<p>The life of Regiomontanus overlapped that of Coppernicus
by three years; the four writers last named were
nearly his contemporaries; and we may therefore be said to
have come to the end of the comparatively stationary period
dealt with in this chapter.</p>

<p><a id="para_70"></a>70. The growing interest in astronomy shewn by the
work of such men as Regiomontanus was one of the early
results in the region of science of the great movement of
thought to different aspects of which are given the names
of Revival of Learning, Renaissance, and Reformation,
The movement may be regarded primarily as a general
quickening of intelligence and of interest in matters of
thought and knowledge. The invention of printing early
in the 15th century, the stimulus to the study of the Greek
authors, due in part to the scholars who were driven westwards
after the capture of Constantinople by the Turks
(1453), and the discovery of America by Columbus in
1492, all helped on a movement the beginning of which
has to be looked for much earlier.</p>

<p>Every stimulus to the intelligence naturally brings with it
a tendency towards inquiry into opinions received through
tradition and based on some great authority. The effective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
discovery and the study of Greek philosophers other
than Aristotle naturally did much to shake the supreme
authority of that great philosopher, just as the Reformers
shook the authority of the Church by pointing out what
they considered to be inconsistencies between its doctrines
and those of the Bible. At first there was little avowed
opposition to the principle that truth was to be derived
from some authority, rather than to be sought independently
by the light of reason; the new scholars replaced
the authority of Aristotle by that of Plato or of Greek and
Roman antiquity in general, and the religious Reformers
replaced the Church by the Bible. Naturally, however,
the conflict between authorities produced in some minds
scepticism as to the principle of authority itself; when
freedom of judgment had to be exercised to the extent
of deciding between authorities, it was but a step further—a
step, it is true, that comparatively few took—to use
the individual judgment on the matter at issue itself.</p>

<p>In astronomy the conflict between authorities had already
arisen, partly in connection with certain divergencies between
Ptolemy and Aristotle, partly in connection with
the various astronomical tables which, though on substantially
the same lines, differed in minor points. The
time was therefore ripe for some fundamental criticism of
the traditional astronomy, and for its reconstruction on a
new basis.</p>

<p>Such a fundamental change was planned and worked
out by the great astronomer whose work has next to be
considered.</p>

<p><a id="para_71"></a>71. <i>Nicholas</i> Coppernic or <i>Coppernicus</i><a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> was born on
February 19th, 1473, in a house still pointed out in the little
trading town of Thorn on the Vistula. Thorn now lies
just within the eastern frontier of the present kingdom of
Prussia; in the time of Coppernicus it lay in a region over
which the King of Poland had some sort of suzerainty, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
precise nature of which was a continual subject of quarrel
between him, the citizens, and the order of Teutonic knights,
who claimed a good deal of the neighbouring country.
The astronomer’s father (whose name was most commonly
written Koppernigk) was a merchant who came to Thorn
from Cracow, then the capital of Poland, in 1462. Whether
Coppernicus should be counted as a Pole or as a German
is an intricate question, over which his biographers have
fought at great length and with some acrimony, but which
is not worth further discussion here.</p>

<p>Nicholas, after the death of his father in 1483, was under
the care of his uncle, Lucas Watzelrode, afterwards bishop
of the neighbouring diocese of Ermland, and was destined
by him from a very early date for an ecclesiastical career.
He attended the school at Thorn, and at the age of 17
entered the University of Cracow. Here he seems to have
first acquired (or shewn) a decided taste for astronomy
and mathematics, subjects in which he probably received
help from Albert Brudzewski, who had a great reputation
as a learned and stimulating teacher; the lecture lists of
the University show that the comparatively modern treatises
of Purbach and Regiomontanus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_68">§&nbsp;68</a>) were
the standard textbooks used. Coppernicus had no intention
of graduating at Cracow, and probably left after three
years (1494). During the next year or two he lived
partly at home, partly at his uncle’s palace at Heilsberg,
and spent some of the time in an unsuccessful candidature
for a canonry at Frauenburg, the cathedral city of his
uncle’s diocese.</p>

<p>The next nine or ten years of his life (from 1496 to
1505 or 1506) were devoted to studying in Italy, his stay
there being broken only by a short visit to Frauenburg in
1501. He worked chiefly at Bologna and Padua, but
graduated at Ferrara, and also spent some time at Rome,
where his astronomical knowledge evidently made a favourable
impression. Although he was supposed to be in
Italy primarily with a view to studying law and medicine,
it is evident that much of his best work was being put
into mathematics and astronomy, while he also paid a good
deal of attention to Greek.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="COPPERNICUS"></a>
<img src="images/i_p094a.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">COPPERNICUS.
<p class="psig"><small><i>To face p. 94.</i></small></p></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>During his absence he was appointed (about 1497) to
a canonry at Frauenburg, and at some uncertain date
be also received a sinecure ecclesiastical appointment at
Breslau.</p>

<p><a id="para_72"></a>72. On returning to Frauenburg from Italy Coppernicus
almost immediately obtained fresh leave of absence, and
joined his uncle at Heilsberg, ostensibly as his medical
adviser and really as his companion.</p>

<p>It was probably during the quiet years spent at Heilsberg
that he first put into shape his new ideas about astronomy,
and wrote the first draft of his book. He kept the
manuscript by him, revising and rewriting from time to
time, partly from a desire to make his work as perfect as
possible, partly from complete indifference to reputation,
coupled with dislike of the controversy to which the
publication of his book would almost certainly give rise.
In 1509 he published at Cracow his first book, a Latin
translation of a set of Greek letters by Theophylactus,
interesting as being probably the first translation from the
Greek ever published in Poland or the adjacent districts.
In 1512, on the death of his uncle, he finally settled in
Frauenburg, in a set of rooms which he occupied, with short
intervals, for the next 31 years. Once fairly in residence,
he took his share in conducting the business of the
Chapter: he acted, for example, more than once as their
representative in various quarrels with the King of Poland
and the Teutonic knights; in 1523 he was general
administrator of the diocese for a few months after the
death of the bishop; and for two periods, amounting altogether
to six years (1516-1519 and 1520-1521), he lived at
the castle of Allenstein, administering some of the outlying
property of the Chapter. In 1521 he was commissioned to
draw up a statement of the grievances of the Chapter
against the Teutonic knights for presentation to the
Prussian Estates, and in the following year wrote a memorandum
on the debased and confused state of the coinage
in the district, a paper which was also laid before the
Estates, and was afterwards rewritten in Latin at the special
request of the bishop. He also gave a certain amount
of medical advice to his friends as well as to the poor of
Frauenburg, though he never practised regularly as a
physician; but notwithstanding these various occupations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
it is probable that a very large part of his time during the
last 30 years of his life was devoted to astronomy.</p>

<p><a id="para_73"></a>73. We are so accustomed to associate the revival of
astronomy, as of other branches of natural science, with
increased care in the collection of observed facts, and to
think of Coppernicus as the chief agent in the revival, that
it is worth while here to emphasise the fact that he was in
no sense a great observer. His instruments, which were
mostly of his own construction, were far inferior to those
of Nassir Eddin and of Ulugh Begh (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_62">§§&nbsp;62</a>, 63),
and not even as good as those which he could have procured
if he had wished from the workshops of Nürnberg;
his observations were not at all numerous (only 27, which
occur in his book, and a dozen or two besides being known),
and he appears to have made no serious attempt to secure
great accuracy. His determination of the position of one
star, which was extensively used by him as a standard of
reference and was therefore of special importance, was in
error to the extent of nearly 40′ (more than the apparent
breadth of the sun or moon), an error which Hipparchus
would have considered very serious. His pupil Rheticus
(<a href="#para_74">§&nbsp;74</a>) reports an interesting discussion between his master
and himself, in which the pupil urged the importance of
making observations with all imaginable accuracy; Coppernicus
answered that minute accuracy was not to be looked
for at that time, and that a rough agreement between theory
and observation was all that he could hope to attain.
Coppernicus moreover points out in more than one place
that the high latitude of Frauenburg and the thickness of
the air were so detrimental to good observation that, for
example, though he had occasionally been able to see the
planet Mercury, he had never been able to observe it
properly.</p>

<p>Although he published nothing of importance till towards
the end of his life, his reputation as an astronomer and
mathematician appears to have been established among
experts from the date of his leaving Italy, and to have
steadily increased as time went on.</p>

<p>In 1515 he was consulted by a committee appointed by
the Lateran Council to consider the reform of the calendar,
which had now fallen into some confusion (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
<a href="#para_22">§&nbsp;22</a>), but he declined to give any advice on the ground
that the motions of the sun and moon were as yet too
imperfectly known for a satisfactory reform to be possible.
A few years later (1524) he wrote an open letter, intended
for publication, to one of his Cracow friends, in reply to a
tract on precession, in which, after the manner of the time,
he used strong language about the errors of his opponent.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>It was meanwhile gradually becoming known that he
held the novel doctrine that the earth was in motion and
the sun and stars at rest, a doctrine which was sufficiently
startling to attract notice outside astronomical circles.
About 1531 he had the distinction of being ridiculed on
the stage at some popular performance in the neighbourhood;
and it is interesting to note (especially in view of
the famous persecution of Galilei at Rome a century later)
that Luther in his <i>Table Talk</i> frankly described Coppernicus
as a fool for holding such opinions, which were obviously
contrary to the Bible, and that Melanchthon, perhaps the
most learned of the Reformers, added to a somewhat similar
criticism a broad hint that such opinions should not be
tolerated. Coppernicus appears to have taken no notice of
these or similar attacks, and still continued to publish nothing.
No observation made later than 1529 occurs in his great
book, which seems to have been nearly in its final form by that
date; and to about this time belongs an extremely interesting
paper, known as the <i>Commentariolus</i>, which contains a
short account of his system of the world, with some of the
evidence for it, but without any calculations. It was
apparently written to be shewn or lent to friends, and was
not published; the manuscript disappeared after the death
of the author and was only rediscovered in 1878. The
<i>Commentariolus</i> was probably the basis of a lecture on
the ideas of Coppernicus given in 1533 by one of the
Roman astronomers at the request of Pope Clement VII.
Three years later Cardinal Schomberg wrote to ask
Coppernicus for further information as to his views, the
letter showing that the chief features were already pretty
accurately known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p><a id="para_74"></a>74. Similar requests must have been made by others, but
his final decision to publish his ideas seems to have been
due to the arrival at Frauenburg in 1539 of the enthusiastic
young astronomer generally known as <i>Rheticus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Born in
1514, he studied astronomy under Schoner at Nürnberg,
and was appointed in 1536 to one of the chairs of
mathematics created by the influence of Melanchthon at
Wittenberg, at that time the chief Protestant University.</p>

<p>Having heard, probably through the <i>Commentariolus</i>, of
Coppernicus and his doctrines, he was so much interested
in them that he decided to visit the great astronomer at
Frauenburg. Coppernicus received him with extreme
kindness, and the visit, which was originally intended to
last a few days or weeks, extended over nearly two years.
Rheticus set to work to study Coppernicus’s manuscript,
and wrote within a few weeks of his arrival an extremely
interesting and valuable account of it, known as the First
Narrative (<i>Prima Narratio</i>), in the form of an open letter
to his old master Schoner, a letter which was printed in the
following spring and was the first easily accessible account
of the new doctrines.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>When Rheticus returned to Wittenberg, towards the end
of 1541, he took with him a copy of a purely mathematical
section of the great book, and had it printed as a textbook
of the subject (Trigonometry); it had probably been already
settled that he was to superintend the printing of the complete
book itself. Coppernicus, who was now an old man
and would naturally feel that his end was approaching, sent
the manuscript to his friend Giese, Bishop of Kulm, to do
what he pleased with. Giese sent it at once to Rheticus,
who made arrangements for having it printed at Nürnberg.
Unfortunately Rheticus was not able to see it all through
the press, and the work had to be entrusted to Osiander,
a Lutheran preacher interested in astronomy. Osiander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
appears to have been much alarmed at the thought of the
disturbance which the heretical ideas of Coppernicus would
cause, and added a prefatory note of his own (which he
omitted to sign), praising the book in a vulgar way, and
declaring (what was quite contrary to the views of the
author) that the fundamental principles laid down in it
were merely abstract hypotheses convenient for purposes
of calculation; he also gave the book the title <i>De
Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium</i> (On the Revolutions of
the Celestial Spheres), the last two words of which were
probably his own addition. The printing was finished in
the winter 1542-3, and the author received a copy of his
book on the day of his death (May 24th, 1543), when his
memory and mental vigour had already gone.</p>

<p><a id="para_75"></a>75. The central idea with which the name of Coppernicus
is associated, and which makes the <i>De Revolutionibus</i> one
of the most important books in all astronomical literature, by
the side of which perhaps only the <i>Almagest</i> and Newton’s
<i>Principia</i> (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_177">§§&nbsp;177</a> <i>seqq.</i>) can be placed, is that
the apparent motions of the celestial bodies are to a great
extent not real motions, but are due to the motion of the
earth carrying the observer with it. Coppernicus tells us
that he had long been struck by the unsatisfactory nature
of the current explanations of astronomical observations,
and that, while searching in philosophical writings for some
better explanation, he had found a reference of Cicero to
the opinion of Hicetas that the earth turned round on its
axis daily. He found similar views held by other Pythagoreans,
while Philolaus and Aristarchus of Samos had
also held that the earth not only rotates, but moves
bodily round the sun or some other centre (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>,
<a href="#para_24">§&nbsp;24</a>). The opinion that the earth is not the sole centre
of motion, but that Venus and Mercury revolve round the
sun, he found to be an old Egyptian belief, supported
also by <i>Martianus Capella</i>, who wrote a compendium of
science and philosophy in the 5th or 6th century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
A more modern authority, <i>Nicholas of Cusa</i> (1401-1464), a
mystic writer who refers to a possible motion of the earth,
was ignored or not noticed by Coppernicus. None of
the writers here named, with the possible exception of
Aristarchus of Samos, to whom Coppernicus apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
paid little attention, presented the opinions quoted as
more than vague speculations; none of them gave any
substantial reasons for, much less a proof of, their views;
and Coppernicus, though he may have been glad, after the
fashion of the age, to have the support of recognised
authorities, had practically to make a fresh start and
elaborate his own evidence for his opinions.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been said that Coppernicus <i>proved</i>
what earlier writers had guessed at or suggested; it would
perhaps be truer to say that he took up certain floating ideas,
which were extremely vague and had never been worked
out scientifically, based on them certain definite fundamental
principles, and from these principles developed
mathematically an astronomical system which he shewed to
be at least as capable of explaining the observed celestial
motions as any existing variety of the traditional Ptolemaic
system. The Coppernican system, as it left the hands of
the author, was in fact decidedly superior to its rivals as
an explanation of ordinary observations, an advantage which
it owed quite as much to the mathematical skill with which
it was developed as to its first principles; it was in many
respects very much simpler; and it avoided certain
fundamental difficulties of the older system. It was however
liable to certain serious objections, which were only
overcome by fresh evidence which was subsequently
brought to light. For the predecessors of Coppernicus
there was, apart from variations of minor importance, but
one scientific system which made any serious attempt to
account for known facts; for his immediate successors there
were two, the newer of which would to an impartial mind
appear on the whole the more satisfactory, and the further
study of the two systems, with a view to the discovery of
fresh arguments or fresh observations tending to support
the one or the other, was immediately suggested as an
inquiry of first-rate importance.</p>

<p><a id="para_76"></a>76. The plan of the <i>De Revolutionibus</i> bears a general
resemblance to that of the <i>Almagest</i>. In form at least
the book is not primarily an argument in favour of the
motion of the earth, and it is possible to read much of
it without ever noticing the presence of this doctrine.</p>

<p>Coppernicus, like Ptolemy, begins with certain first prin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>ciples
or postulates, but on account of their novelty takes
a little more trouble than his predecessor (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>,
<a href="#para_47">§&nbsp;47</a>) to make them at once appear probable. With
these postulates as a basis he proceeds to develop, by
means of elaborate and rather tedious mathematical reasoning,
aided here and there by references to observations,
detailed schemes of the various celestial motions; and it
is by the agreement of these calculations with observations,
far more than by the general reasoning given at the
beginning, that the various postulates are in effect justified.</p>

<p>His first postulate, that the universe is spherical, is
supported by vague and inconclusive reasons similar to
those given by Ptolemy and others; for the spherical form
of the earth he gives several of the usual valid arguments,
one of his proofs for its curvature from east to west being
the fact that eclipses visible at one place are not visible
at another. A third postulate, that the motions of the
celestial bodies are uniform circular motions or are compounded
of such motions, is, as might be expected, supported
only by reasons of the most unsatisfactory character.
He argues, for example, that any want of uniformity in
motion</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“must arise either from irregularity in the moving power,
whether this be within the body or foreign to it, or from some
inequality of the body in revolution.... Both of which things
the intellect shrinks from with horror, it being unworthy to hold
such a view about bodies which are constituted in the most
perfect order.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_77"></a>77. The discussion of the possibility that the earth may
move, and may even have more than one motion, then
follows, and is more satisfactory though by no means conclusive.
Coppernicus has a firm grasp of the principle,
which Aristotle had also enunciated, sometimes known as
that of relative motion, which he states somewhat as
follows:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>“For all change in position which is seen is due to a motion

<p>Coppernicus gives no proof of this principle, regarding
it probably as sufficiently obvious, when once stated, to
the mathematicians and astronomers for whom he was
writing. It is, however, so fundamental that it may be
worth while to discuss it a little more fully.</p>

<p>Let, for example, the observer be at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and an object at
<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, then whether the object move from <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">B′</span>, the observer
remaining at rest, or the observer move an <i>equal</i> distance
in the <i>opposite</i> direction, from <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">A′</span>, the object remaining
at rest, the effect is to the eye exactly the same, since in
either case the distance between the observer and object
and the direction in which the object is seen, represented
in the first case by <span class="smcap lowercase">A B′</span> and in the second by <span class="smcap lowercase">A′ B</span>, are the
same.</p>

<p>Thus if in the course of a year <i>either</i> the sun passes
successively through the positions <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> (fig. 38), the
earth remaining at rest at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, <i>or</i> if the sun is at rest and
the earth passes successively through the positions <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
at the corresponding times, the sun remaining at rest at <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>,
exactly the same effect is produced on the eye, provided
that the lines <i>a</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, <i>b</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, <i>c</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, <i>d</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> are, as in the figure, equal in
length and parallel in direction to <span class="smcap lowercase">E A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E C</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E D</span> respectively.
The same being true of intermediate points,
exactly the same apparent effect is produced whether the
sun describe the circle <span class="smcap lowercase">A B C D</span>, or the earth describe at
the same rate the equal circle <i>a b c d</i>. It will be noticed
further that, although the corresponding motions in the
two cases are at the same times in <i>opposite</i> directions (as
at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <i>a</i>), yet each circle as a whole is described,
as indicated by the arrowheads, in the <i>same</i> direction
(contrary to that of the motion of the hands of a clock,
in the figures given). It follows in the same sort of way
that an apparent motion (as of a planet) may be explained
as due partially to the motion of the object, partially to
that of the observer.</p>

<p>Coppernicus gives the familiar illustration of the

</div>

<p><a id="para_78"></a>78. The application of the same ideas to an apparent
rotation round the observer, as in the case of the apparent
daily motion of the celestial sphere, is a little more difficult.
It must be remembered that the eye has no means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
judging the direction of an object taken by itself; it can
only judge the difference between the direction of the
object and some other direction, whether that of another
object or a direction fixed in some way by the body
of the observer. Thus when after looking at a star twice
at an interval of time we decide that it has moved, this
means that its direction has changed relatively to, say, some
tree or house which we had noticed nearly in its direction,
or that its direction has changed relatively to the direction
in which we are directing our eyes or holding our bodies.
Such a change can evidently be interpreted as a change of
direction, either of the star
or of the line from the eye
to the tree which we used
as a line of reference. To
apply this to the case of the
celestial sphere, let us suppose
that S represents a star
on the celestial sphere, which
(for simplicity) is overhead
to an observer on the earth
at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, this being determined
by comparison with a line
<span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span> drawn upright on the
earth. Next, earth and celestial
sphere being supposed
to have a common centre
at <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, let us suppose <i>firstly</i>
that the celestial sphere turns round (in the direction of
the hands of a clock) till <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> comes to <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span>, and that the
observer now sees the star on his horizon or in a direction
at right angles to the original direction <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, the angle
turned through by the celestial sphere being <span class="smcap lowercase">S O S′</span>; and
<i>secondly</i> that, the celestial sphere being unchanged, the
earth turns round in the opposite direction, till <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span> comes
to <span class="smcap lowercase">A′ B′</span>, and the star is again seen by the observer on his
horizon. Whichever of these motions has taken place,
the observer sees exactly the same apparent motion in the
sky; and the figure shews at once that the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">S O S′</span>
through which the celestial sphere was supposed to turn
in the first case is equal to the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A O A′</span> through which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the earth turns in the second case, but that the two
rotations are in opposite directions. A similar explanation
evidently applies to more complicated cases.</p>

<p>Hence the apparent daily rotation of the celestial sphere
about an axis through the poles would be produced equally
well, either by an actual rotation of this character, or by
a rotation of the earth about an axis also passing through
the poles, and at the same rate, but in the opposite
direction, <i>i.e.</i> from west to east. This is the first motion
which Coppernicus assigns to the earth.</p>

<p><a id="para_79"></a>79. The apparent annual motion of the sun, in accordance
with which it appears to revolve round the earth in a path
which is nearly a circle, can be equally well explained by
supposing the sun to be at rest, and the earth to describe
an exactly equal path round the sun, the direction of the
revolution being the same. This is virtually the second
motion which Coppernicus gives to the earth, though, on
account of a peculiarity in his geometrical method, he
resolves this motion into two others, and combines with
one of these a further small motion which is required for
precession.<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p><a id="para_80"></a>80. Coppernicus’s conception then is that the earth
revolves round the sun in the plane of the ecliptic, while
rotating daily on an axis which continually points to the
poles of the celestial sphere, and therefore retains (save for
precession) a fixed direction in space.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that the two motions thus assigned
to the earth are perfectly distinct; each requires its own
proof, and explains a different set of appearances. It was
quite possible, with perfect consistency, to believe in one
motion without believing in the other, as in fact a very
few of the 16th-century astronomers did (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_105">§&nbsp;105</a>).</p>

<p>In giving his reasons for believing in the motion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
earth Coppernicus discusses the chief objections which had
been urged by Ptolemy. To the objection that if the earth
had a rapid motion of rotation about its axis, the earth
would be in danger of flying to pieces, and the air, as well
as loose objects on the surface, would be left behind, he
replies that if such a motion were dangerous to the solid
earth, it must be much more so to the celestial sphere, which,
on account of its vastly greater size, would have to move
enormously faster than the earth to complete its daily
rotation; he enters also into an obscure discussion of
difference between a “natural” and an “artificial” motion,
of which the former might be expected not to disturb
anything on the earth.</p>

<p>Coppernicus shews that the earth is very small compared
to the sphere of the stars, because wherever the observer
is on the earth the horizon appears to divide the celestial
sphere into two equal parts and the observer appears always
to be at the centre of the sphere, so that any distance
through which the observer moves on the earth is imperceptible
as compared with the distance of the stars.</p>

<p><a id="para_81"></a>81. He goes on to argue that the chief irregularity in the
motion of the planets, in virtue of which they move backwards
at intervals (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_14">§&nbsp;14</a>, and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_51">§&nbsp;51</a>),
can readily be explained in general by the motion of the
earth and by a motion of each planet round the sun, in its
own time and at its own distance. From the fact that
Venus and Mercury were never seen very far from the sun,
it could be inferred that their paths were nearer to the sun
than that of the earth. Mercury being the nearer to the sun
of the two, because never seen so far from it in the sky as
Venus. The other three planets, being seen at times in a
direction opposite to that of the sun, must necessarily
evolve round the sun in orbits larger than that of the
earth, a view confirmed by the fact that they were brightest
when opposite the sun (in which positions they would be
nearest to us). The order of their respective distances
from the sun could be at once inferred from the disturbing
effects produced on their apparent motions by the motion
of the earth; Saturn being least affected must on the whole
be farthest from the earth, Jupiter next, and Mars next.
The earth thus became one of six planets revolving round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the sun, the order of distance—Mercury, Venus, Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn—being also in accordance with the
rates of motion round the sun, Mercury performing its
revolution most rapidly (in about 88 days<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>), Saturn most
slowly (in about 30 years). On the Coppernican system
the moon alone still revolved round the earth, being the
only celestial body the status of which was substantially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
unchanged; and thus Coppernicus was able to give the
accompanying diagram of the solar system (fig. 40), representing
his view of its general arrangement (though not of
the right proportions of the different parts) and of the
various motions.</p>

<p>In fig. 41 <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> represent the centre of the earth in four
positions, occupied by it about December 23rd, March 21st,
June 22nd, and September 22nd respectively (<i>i.e.</i> at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
beginnings of the four seasons, according to astronomical
reckoning); the circle <span class="smcap lowercase">F G H I</span> in each of its positions
represents the equator of the earth, <i>i.e.</i> a great circle on
the earth the plane of which is perpendicular to the axis
of the earth and is consequently always parallel to the
celestial equator. This circle is not in the plane of
the ecliptic, but tilted up at an angle of 23-1∕2°, so that <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>
must always be supposed <i>below</i> and <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span> <i>above</i> the plane of
the paper (which represents the ecliptic); the equator cuts
the ecliptic along <span class="smcap lowercase">G I</span>. The diagram (in accordance with the
common custom in astronomical diagrams) represents the
various circles as seen from the north side of the equator
and ecliptic. When the earth is at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, the north pole (as is
shewn more clearly in fig. 42, in which <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">P′</span> denote the
north pole and south pole respectively) is turned away
from the sun, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, which is on the lower or south side of the
plane of the equator, and consequently inhabitants of the
northern hemisphere see the sun for less than half the day,
while those on the southern hemisphere see the sun for more
than half the day, and those beyond the line <span class="smcap lowercase">K L</span> (in fig. 42)
see the sun during the whole day. Three months later,
when the earth’s centre is at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> (fig. 41), the sun lies in the
plane of the equator, the poles of the earth are turned
neither towards nor away from the sun, but aside, and all
over the earth daylight lasts for 12 hours and night for an
equal time. Three months later still, when the earth’s
centre is at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, the sun is above the plane of the equator,
and the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere see the
sun for more than half the day, those on the southern
hemisphere for less than half, while those in parts of the
earth farther north than the line <span class="smcap lowercase">M N</span> (in fig. 42) see the
sun for the whole 24 hours. Finally, when, at the autumn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
equinox, the earth has reached <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> (fig. 41), the sun is again
in the plane of the equator, and the day is everywhere equal
to the night.</p>

<p><a id="para_83"></a>83. Coppernicus devotes the first eleven chapters of the
first book to this preliminary sketch of his system; the
remainder of this book he fills with some mathematical
propositions and tables, which, as previously mentioned
(<a href="#para_74">§&nbsp;74</a>), had already been separately printed by Rheticus.
The second book contains chiefly a number of the usual
results relating to the celestial sphere and its apparent
daily motion, treated much as by earlier writers, but with
greater mathematical skill. Incidentally Coppernicus gives
his measurement of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and infers
from a comparison with earlier observations that the
obliquity had decreased, which was in fact the case, though
to a much less extent than his imperfect observations
indicated. The book ends with a catalogue of stars, which
is Ptolemy’s catalogue, occasionally corrected by fresh
observations, and rearranged so as to avoid the effects of
precession.<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> When, as frequently happened, the Greek
and Latin versions of the <i>Almagest</i> gave, owing to copyists’
or printers’ errors, different results, Coppernicus appears to
have followed sometimes the Latin and sometimes the
Greek version, without in general attempting to ascertain
by fresh observations which was right.</p>

<p><a id="para_84"></a>84. The third book begins with an elaborate discussion
of the precession of the equinoxes (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>). From
a comparison of results obtained by Timocharis, by later
Greek astronomers, and by Albategnius, Coppernicus infers
that the amount of precession has varied, but that its
average value is 50″·2 annually (almost exactly the true
value), and accepts accordingly Tabit ben Korra’s unhappy
suggestion of the trepidation (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_58">§&nbsp;58</a>). An
examination of the data used by Coppernicus shews that
the erroneous or fraudulent observations of Ptolemy
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_50">§&nbsp;50</a>) are chiefly responsible for the perpetuation
of this mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>Of much more interest than the detailed discussion of trepidation
and of geometrical schemes for representing it is
the interpretation of precession as the result of a motion of
the earth’s axis. Precession was originally recognised by
Hipparchus as a motion of the celestial equator, in which
its inclination to the ecliptic was sensibly unchanged.
Now the ideas of Coppernicus make the celestial equator
dependent on the equator of the earth, and hence on its
axis; it is in fact a great circle of the celestial sphere
which is always perpendicular to the axis about which the
earth rotates daily. Hence precession, on the theory of
Coppernicus, arises from a slow motion of the axis of the
earth, which moves so as always to remain inclined at the
same angle to the ecliptic, and to return to its original
position after a period of about 26,000 years (since a
motion of 50″·2 annually is equivalent to 360° or a complete
circuit in that period); in other words, the earth’s axis
has a slow conical motion, the central line (or axis) of the
cone being at right angles to the plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p><a id="para_85"></a>85. Precession being dealt with, the greater part of the
remainder of the third book is devoted to a discussion in
detail of the apparent annual motion of the sun round the
earth, corresponding to the real annual motion of the earth
round the sun. The geometrical theory of the <i>Almagest</i>
was capable of being immediately applied to the new system,
and Coppernicus, like Ptolemy, uses an eccentric. He
makes the calculations afresh, arrives at a smaller and more
accurate value of the eccentricity (about 1∕31 instead of 1∕24),
fixes the position of the apogee and perigee (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_39">§&nbsp;39</a>),
or rather of the equivalent <b>aphelion</b> and <b>perihelion</b> (<i>i.e.</i> the
points in the earth’s orbit where it is respectively farthest
from and nearest to the sun), and thus verifies Albategnius’s
discovery (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_59">§&nbsp;59</a>) of the motion of the line of
apses. The theory of the earth’s motion is worked out in
some detail, and tables are given whereby the apparent place
of the sun at any time can be easily computed.</p>

<p>The fourth book deals with the theory of the moon. As
has been already noticed, the moon was the only celestial
body the position of which in the universe was substantially
unchanged by Coppernicus, and it might hence have been
expected that little alteration would have been required in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the traditional theory. Actually, however, there is scarcely
any part of the subject in which Coppernicus did more to
diminish the discrepancies between theory and observation.
He rejects Ptolemy’s equant (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_51">§&nbsp;51</a>), partly on
the ground that it produces an irregular motion unsuitable
for the heavenly bodies, partly on the more substantial
ground that, as already pointed out (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_48">§&nbsp;48</a>),
Ptolemy’s theory makes the apparent size of the moon at
times twice as great as at others. By an arrangement of
epicycles Coppernicus succeeded in representing the chief
irregularities in the moon’s motion, including evection, but
without Ptolemy’s prosneusis (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_48">§&nbsp;48</a>) or Abul
Wafa’s inequality (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_60">§&nbsp;60</a>), while he made the
changes in the moon’s distance, and consequently in its
apparent size, not very much greater than those which
actually take place, the difference being imperceptible by
the rough methods of observation which he used.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>In discussing the distances and sizes of the sun and
moon Coppernicus follows Ptolemy closely (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, §&nbsp;49;
cf. also fig. 20); he arrives at substantially the same estimate
of the distance of the moon, but makes the sun’s distance
1,500 times the earth’s radius, thus improving to some extent
on the traditional estimate, which was based on Ptolemy’s.
He also develops in some detail the effect of parallax on
the apparent place of the moon, and the variations in the
apparent size, owing to the variations in distance: and the
book ends with a discussion of eclipses.</p>

<p><a id="para_86"></a>86. The last two books (V. and VI.) deal at length with
the motion of the planets.</p>

<p>In the cases of Mercury and Venus, Ptolemy’s explanation
of the motion could with little difficulty be rearranged
so as to fit the ideas of Coppernicus. We have seen
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_51">§&nbsp;51</a>) that, minor irregularities being ignored,
the motion of either of these planets could be represented
by means of an epicycle moving on a deferent, the centre of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
the epicycle being always in the direction of the sun, the
ratio of the sizes of the epicycle and deferent being fixed,
but the actual dimensions being practically arbitrary.
Ptolemy preferred on the whole to regard the epicycles of
both these planets as lying between the earth and the sun.
The idea of making the sun a centre of motion having once
been accepted, it was an obvious simplification to make
the centre of the epicycle not merely lie in the direction
of the sun, but actually be the sun. In fact, if the planet
in question revolved round the sun at the proper distance
and at the proper rate, the same appearances would be
produced as by Ptolemy’s epicycle and deferent, the path
of the planet round the sun replacing the epicycle, and the
apparent path of the sun round the earth (or the path of
the earth round the sun) replacing the deferent.</p>

<p>In discussing the time of revolution of a planet a distinction
has to be made, as in the case of the moon (chapter
<span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_40">§&nbsp;40</a>), between the synodic and sidereal periods of
revolution. Venus, for example, is seen as an evening star<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
at its greatest angular distance from the sun (as at <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span> in
fig. 43) at intervals of about 584 days. This is therefore
the time which Venus takes to return to the same position
relatively to the sun, as seen from the earth, or relatively
to the earth, as seen from the sun; this time is called
the <b>synodic period</b>. But as during this time the line <span class="smcap lowercase">E S</span>
has changed its direction, Venus is no longer in the
same position relatively to the stars, as seen either from
the sun or from the earth. If at first Venus and the
earth are at <span class="smcap">V<sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="smcap">E<sub>1</sub></span>; respectively, after 584 days (or about
a year and seven months) the earth will have performed
rather more than a revolution and a half round the
sun and will be at <span class="smcap">E<sub>2</sub></span>; Venus being again at the greatest
distance from the sun will therefore be at <span class="smcap">V<sub>2</sub></span>, but will
evidently be seen in quite a different part of the sky,
and will not have performed an exact revolution round the
sun. It is important to know how long the line <span class="smcap">S V<sub>1</sub></span> takes
to return to the same position, <i>i.e.</i> how long Venus takes
to return to the same position with respect to the stars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
as seen from the sun, an interval of time known as the
<b>sidereal period</b>. This can evidently be calculated by a
simple rule-of-three sum from the data given. For Venus
has in 584 days gained a complete revolution on the
earth, or has gone as far as the earth would have gone in
584 + 365 or 949 days (fractions of days being omitted for
simplicity); hence Venus goes in 584 × 365∕949 days as far
as the earth in 365 days, <i>i.e.</i> Venus completes a revolution
in 584 × 365∕949 or 225 days. This is therefore the sidereal
period of Venus. The process used by Coppernicus was
different, as he saw the advantage of using a long period of
time, so as to diminish the error due to minor irregularities,
and he therefore obtained two observations of Venus at
a considerable interval of time, in which Venus occupied
very nearly the same position both with respect to the sun
and to the stars, so that the interval of time contained very
nearly an exact number of sidereal periods as well as of
synodic periods. By dividing therefore the observed
interval of time by the number of sidereal periods (which
being a whole number could readily be estimated), the
sidereal period was easily obtained. A similar process
shewed that the synodic period of Mercury was about 116
days, and the sidereal period about 88 days.</p>

<p>The comparative sizes of the orbits of Venus and
Mercury as compared with that of the earth could easily
be ascertained from observations of the position of either
planet when most distant from the sun. Venus, for
example, appears at its greatest distance from the sun when
at a point <span class="smcap">V<sub>1</sub></span> (fig. 44) such that <span class="smcap">V<sub>1</sub> E<sub>1</sub></span> touches the circle in
which Venus moves, and the angle <span class="smcap">E<sub>1</sub> V<sub>1</sub> S</span> is then (by
a known property of a circle) a right angle. The angle
<span class="smcap">S E<sub>1</sub> V<sub>1</sub></span> being observed, the shape of the triangle <span class="smcap">S E<sub>1</sub> V<sub>1</sub></span> is
known, and the ratio of its sides can be readily calculated.
Thus Coppernicus found that the average distance of
Venus from the sun was about 72 and that of Mercury
about 36, the distance of the earth from the sun being
taken to be 100; the corresponding modern figures are
72·3 and 38·7.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>—The epicycle of Jupiter.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_87"></a>87. In the case of the superior planets. Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn, it was much more difficult to recognise that
their motions could be explained by supposing them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
revolve round the sun, since the centre of the epicycle
did not always lie in the direction of the sun, but might
be anywhere in the ecliptic. One peculiarity, however,
in the motion of any of the superior planets might easily
have suggested their motion round the sun, and was either
completely overlooked by Ptolemy or not recognised by
him as important. It is possible that it was one of the
clues which led Coppernicus to his system. This peculiarity
is that the radius of the epicycle of the planet,
<i>j</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span>, is always parallel to the line <span class="smcap lowercase">E S</span> joining the earth
and sun, and consequently performs a complete revolution
in a year. This
connection between the
motion of the planet and
that of the sun received
no explanation from
Ptolemy’s theory. Now
if we draw <span class="smcap lowercase">E J′</span> parallel
to <i>j</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> and equal to it in
length, it is easily seen<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
that the line <span class="smcap lowercase">J′ J</span> is equal
and parallel to <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> <i>j</i>, that
consequently <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> describes
a circle round <span class="smcap lowercase">J′</span> just as
<i>j</i> round <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>. Hence the
motion of the planet can
equally well be represented
by supposing it to move in an epicycle (represented
by the large dotted circle in the figure) of which <span class="smcap lowercase">J′</span> is the
centre and <span class="smcap lowercase">J′ J</span> the radius, while the centre of the epicycle,
remaining always in the direction of the sun, describes
a deferent (represented by the small circle round <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>) of which
the earth is the centre. By this method of representation
the motion of the superior planet is exactly like that of
an inferior planet, except that its epicycle is larger than
its deferent; the same reasoning as before shows that the
motion can be represented simply by supposing the centre
<span class="smcap lowercase">J′</span> of the epicycle to be actually the sun. Ptolemy’s epicycle
and deferent are therefore capable of being replaced, without
affecting the position of the planet in the sky, by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
motion of the planet in a circle round the sun, while the
sun moves round the earth, or, more simply, the earth
round the sun.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_46"></a>
<img src="images/i_p117.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—The relative sizes of the orbits of the earth and of a
superior planet.</div>
</div>

<p>The synodic period of a superior planet could best be
determined by observing when the planet was in opposition,
<i>i.e.</i> when it was (nearly) opposite the sun, or, more
accurately (since a planet does not move exactly in the
ecliptic), when the longitudes of the planet and sun differed
by 180° (or two right angles, chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§&nbsp;43</a>). The
sidereal period could then be deduced nearly as in the case
of an inferior planet, with this difference, that the superior
planet moves more slowly than the earth, and therefore <i>loses</i>
one complete revolution in each synodic period; or the
sidereal period might be found as before by observing
when oppositions occurred nearly in the same part of the
sky.<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Coppernicus thus obtained very fairly accurate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
values for the synodic and sidereal periods, <i>viz.</i> 780 days
and 687 days respectively for Mars, 399 days and about
12 years for Jupiter, 378 days and 30 years for Saturn
(cf. fig. 40).</p>

<p>The calculation of the distance of a superior planet
from the sun is a good deal more complicated than that
of Venus or Mercury. If we ignore various details, the
process followed by Coppernicus is to compute the position
of the planet as seen from the sun, and then to notice
when this position differs most from its position as seen
from the earth, <i>i.e.</i> when the earth and sun are farthest apart
as seen from the planet. This is clearly when (fig. 46)
the line joining the planet (<span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>) to the earth (<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>) touches the
circle described by the earth, so that the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">S P E</span> is
then as great as possible. The angle <span class="smcap lowercase">P E S</span> is a right
angle, and the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">S P E</span> is the difference between the
observed place of the planet and its computed place as
seen from the sun; these two angles being thus known, the
shape of the triangle <span class="smcap lowercase">S P E</span> is known, and therefore also
the ratio of its sides. In this way Coppernicus found
the average distances of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn from the
sun to be respectively about 1-1∕2, 5, and 9 times that of the
earth; the corresponding modern figures are 1·5, 5·2, 9·5.</p>

<p><a id="para_88"></a>88. The explanation of the stationary points of the
planets (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, <a href="#para_14">§&nbsp;14</a>) is much simplified by the ideas of
Coppernicus. If we take first an inferior planet, say Mercury
(fig. 47), then when it lies between the earth and sun, as
at <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> (or as on Sept. 5 in fig. 7), both the earth and Mercury
are moving in the same direction, but a comparison
of the sizes of the paths of Mercury and the earth, and of
their respective times of performing complete circuits, shews
that Mercury is moving faster than the earth. Consequently
to the observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, Mercury appears to be moving from
left to right (in the figure), or from east to west; but this
is contrary to the general direction of motion of the planets,
<i>i.e.</i> Mercury appears to be retrograding. On the other
hand, when Mercury appears at the greatest distance from
the sun, as at <span class="smcap">M<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="smcap">M<sub>2</sub></span>, its own motion is directly towards
or away from the earth, and is therefore imperceptible;
but the earth is moving towards the observer’s right, and
therefore Mercury appears to be moving towards the left,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
or from west to east. Hence between <span class="smcap">M<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> its motion
has changed from direct to retrograde, and therefore at
some intermediate point, say <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, (about Aug, 23 in fig. 7),
Mercury appears for the moment to be stationary, and
similarly it appears to be stationary again when at some point
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i> between <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> and <span class="smcap">M<sub>2</sub></span> (about Sept. 13 in fig. 7).</p>

<a id="Fig_47"></a>
<img src="images/i_p119.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>—The stationary points of Mercury.</div>
</div>

<p>In the case of a superior planet, say Jupiter, the argument
is nearly the same. When in opposition at <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> (as on
Mar. 26 in fig. 6), Jupiter moves more slowly than the
earth, and in the same direction, and therefore appears to
be moving in the opposite direction to the earth, <i>i.e.</i> as seen
from <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> (fig. 48), from left to right, or from east to west, that
is in the retrograde direction. But when Jupiter is in
either of the positions <span class="smcap">J<sub>1</sub></span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> (in which the earth appears
to the observer on Jupiter to be at its greatest distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
from the sun), the motion of the earth itself being directly
to or from Jupiter produces no effect on the apparent
motion of Jupiter (since any displacement directly to or
from the observer makes no difference in the object’s
place on the celestial sphere); but Jupiter itself is actually
moving towards the left, and therefore the motion of
Jupiter appears to be also from right to left, or from west
to east. Hence, as before, between <span class="smcap">J<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> and between
<span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> and <span class="smcap">J<sub>2</sub></span> there must be points <i>j<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>j<sub>2</sub></i> (Jan. 24 and May 27,
in fig. 6) at which Jupiter appears for the moment to be
stationary.</p>

<img src="images/i_p120.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>—The stationary points of Jupiter.</div>
</div>

<p>The actual discussion of the stationary points given by
Coppernicus is a good deal more elaborate and more
technical than the outline given here, as he not only shews<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
that the stationary points must exist, but shews how to
calculate their exact positions.</p>

<p><a id="para_89"></a>89. So far the theory of the planets has only been
sketched very roughly, in order to bring into prominence
the essential differences between the Coppernican and the
Ptolemaic explanations of their motions, and no account
has been taken of the minor irregularities for which Ptolemy
devised his system of equants, eccentrics, etc., nor of the
motion in latitude, <i>i.e.</i> to and from the ecliptic. Coppernicus,
as already mentioned, rejected the equant, as being
productive of an irregularity “unworthy” of the celestial
bodies, and constructed for each planet a fairly complicated
system of epicycles. For the motion in latitude discussed
in Book VI. he supposed the orbit of each planet
round the sun to be inclined to the ecliptic at a small
angle, different for each planet, but found it necessary, in
order that his theory should agree with observation, to
introduce the wholly imaginary complication of a regular
increase and decrease in the inclinations of the orbits of
the planets to the ecliptic.</p>

<p>The actual details of the epicycles employed are of no
great interest now, but it may be worth while to notice that
for the motions of the moon, earth, and five other planets
Coppernicus required altogether 34 circles, <i>viz.</i> four for the
moon, three for the earth, seven for Mercury (the motion
of which is peculiarly irregular), and five for each of the
other planets; this number being a good deal less than
that required in most versions of Ptolemy’s system:
Fracastor (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_69">§&nbsp;69</a>), for example, writing in 1538,
required 79 spheres, of which six were required for the
fixed stars.</p>

<p><a id="para_90"></a>90. The planetary theory of Coppernicus necessarily
suffered from one of the essential defects of the system of
epicycles. It is, in fact, always possible to choose a system
of epicycles in such a way as to make <i>either</i> the direction of
any body <i>or</i> its distance vary in any required manner, but
not to satisfy both requirements at once. In the case of the
motion of the moon round the earth, or of the earth round
the sun, cases in which variations in distance could not
readily be observed, epicycles might therefore be expected
to give a satisfactory result, at any rate until methods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
observation were sufficiently improved to measure with some
accuracy the apparent sizes of the sun and moon, and so
check the variations in their distances. But any variation
in the distance of the earth from the sun would affect not
merely the distance, but also the direction in which a planet
would be seen; in the figure, for example, when the planet
is at <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> and the sun at <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, the apparent position of the planet,
as seen from the earth, will be different according as the
earth is at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">E′</span>. Hence the epicycles and eccentrics of
Coppernicus, which had to be adjusted in such a way that
they necessarily involved incorrect values of the distances
between the sun and earth, gave rise to corresponding
errors in the observed places of the planets. The observations
which Coppernicus used were hardly extensive or
accurate enough to show this discrepancy clearly; but a
crucial test was thus virtually suggested by means of which,
when further observations of the planets had been made,
a decision could be taken between an epicyclic representation
of the motion of the planets and some other geometrical
scheme.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="para_91"></a>91. The merits of Coppernicus are so great, and the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
which he played in the overthrow of the Ptolemaic system
is so conspicuous, that we are sometimes liable to forget
that, so far from rejecting the epicycles and eccentrics of
the Greeks, he used no other geometrical devices, and was
even a more orthodox “epicyclist” than Ptolemy himself,
as he rejected the equants of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Milton’s famous

<div class="verse">With Centric and Eccentric scribbled o’er,</div>
<div class="verse">Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>applies therefore just as well to the astronomy of Coppernicus
as to that of his predecessors; and it was Kepler
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>), writing more than half a century later, not
Coppernicus, to whom the rejection of the epicycle and
eccentric is due.</p>

<p><a id="para_92"></a>92. One point which was of importance in later
controversies deserves special mention here. The basis
of the Coppernican system was that a motion of the
earth carrying the observer with it produced an apparent
motion of other bodies. The apparent motions of the
sun and planets were thus shewn to be in great part
explicable as the result of the motion of the earth round
the sun. Similar reasoning ought apparently to lead
to the conclusion that the fixed stars would also appear
to have an annual motion. There would, in fact, be a
displacement of the apparent position of a star due to
the alteration of the earth’s position in its orbit, closely
resembling the alteration in the apparent position of the
moon due to the alteration of the observer’s position
on the earth which had long been studied under the name
of parallax (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§&nbsp;43</a>). As such a displacement
had never been observed, Coppernicus explained the
apparent contradiction by supposing the fixed stars so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
far off that any motion due to this cause was too small
to be noticed. If, for example, the earth moves in six
months from <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">E′</span>, the change in direction of a star at
<span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> is the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">E′ S′ E</span>, which is less than that of a nearer
star at <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>; and by supposing the star <span class="smcap lowercase">S′</span> sufficiently remote,
the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">E′ S′ E</span> can be made as small as may be required.
For instance, if the distance of the star were 300 times
the distance <span class="smcap lowercase">E E′</span>, <i>i.e.</i> 600 times as far from the earth as
the sun is, the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">E S′ E′</span> would be less than 12′,
a quantity which the instruments of the time were barely
capable of detecting.<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> But more accurate observations
of the fixed stars might be expected to throw further light
on this problem.</p>

<p><a id="para_93"></a>93. The publication of the <i>De Revolutionibus</i> appears to
have been received much more quietly than might have
been expected from the startling nature of its contents.
The book, in fact, was so written as to be unintelligible except
to mathematicians of considerable knowledge and ability,
and could not have been read at all generally. Moreover
the preface, inserted by Osiander but generally supposed
to be by the author himself, must have done a good deal
to disarm the hostile criticism due to prejudice and custom,
by representing the fundamental principles of Coppernicus
as mere geometrical abstractions, convenient for calculating
the celestial motions. Although, as we have seen
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_73">§&nbsp;73</a>), the contradiction between the opinions
of Coppernicus and the common interpretation of various
passages in the Bible was promptly noticed by Luther,
Melanchthon, and others, no objection was raised either
by the Pope to whom the book was dedicated, or by his
immediate successors.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic advocacy of the Coppernican views by
Rheticus has already been referred to. The only other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
astronomer of note who at once accepted the new views
was his friend and colleague <i>Erasmus Reinhold</i> (born
at Saalfeld in 1511), who occupied the chief chair of
mathematics and astronomy at Wittenberg from 1536 to
1553, and it thus happened, curiously enough, that the
doctrines so emphatically condemned by two of the great
Protestant leaders were championed principally in what
was generally regarded as the very centre of Protestant
thought.</p>

<p><a id="para_94"></a>94. Rheticus, after the publication of the <i>Narratio
Prima</i> and of an Ephemeris or Almanack based on
Coppernican principles (1550), occupied himself principally
with the calculation of a very extensive set of mathematical
tables, which he only succeeded in finishing just before his
death in 1576.</p>

<p>Reinhold rendered to astronomy the extremely important
service of calculating, on the basis of the <i>De Revolutionibus</i>,
tables of the motions of the celestial bodies, which were
published in 1551 at the expense of Duke Albert of Prussia
and hence called <i>Tabulæ Prutenicæ</i>, or <i>Prussian Tables</i>.
Reinhold revised most of the calculations made by Coppernicus,
whose arithmetical work was occasionally at fault;
but the chief object of the tables was the development in
great detail of the work in the <i>De Revolutionibus</i>, in such
a form that the places of the chief celestial bodies at any
required time could be ascertained with ease. The author
claimed for his tables that from them the places of all the
heavenly bodies could be computed for the past 3,000 years,
and would agree with all observations recorded during that
period. The tables were indeed found to be on the whole
decidedly superior to their predecessors the <i>Alfonsine
Tables</i> (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_66">§&nbsp;66</a>), and gradually came more and
more into favour, until superseded three-quarters of a century
later by the <i>Rudolphine Tables</i> of Kepler (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>,
<a href="#para_148">§&nbsp;148</a>). This superiority of the new tables was only
indirectly connected with the difference in the principles
on which the two sets of tables were based, and was largely
due to the facts that Reinhold was a much better computer
than the assistants of Alfonso, and that Coppernicus, if
not a better mathematician than Ptolemy, at any rate had
better mathematical tools at command. Nevertheless the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
tables naturally, had great weight in inducing the astronomical
world gradually to recognise the merits of the
Coppernican system, at any rate as a basis for calculating
the places of the celestial bodies.</p>

<p>Reinhold was unfortunately cut off by the plague in
1553, and with him disappeared a commentary on the <i>De
Revolutionibus</i> which he had prepared but not published.</p>

<p><a id="para_95"></a>95. Very soon afterwards we find the first signs that the
Coppernican system had spread into England. In 1556
<i>John Field</i> published an almanack for the following year
avowedly based on Coppernicus and Reinhold, and a
passage in the <i>Whetstone of Witte</i> (1557) by <i>Robert Recorde</i>
(1510-1558), our first writer on algebra, shews that the
author regarded the doctrines of Coppernicus with favour,
even if he did not believe in them entirely. A few years
later <i>Thomas Digges</i> (?-1595), in his <i>Alae sive Scalae Mathematicae</i>
(1573), an astronomical treatise of no great importance,
gave warm praise to Coppernicus and his ideas.</p>

<p><a id="para_96"></a>96. For nearly half a century after the death of Reinhold
no important contributions were made to the Coppernican
controversy. Reinhold’s tables were doubtless slowly
doing their work in familiarising men’s minds with the
new ideas, but certain definite additions to knowledge had
to be made before the evidence for them could be regarded
as really conclusive.</p>

<p>The serious mechanical difficulties connected with the
assumption of a rapid motion of the earth which is quite
imperceptible to its inhabitants could only be met by
further progress in mechanics, and specially in knowledge
of the laws according to which the motion of bodies is
produced, kept up, changed, or destroyed; in this direction
no considerable progress was made before the time of
Galilei, whose work falls chiefly into the early 17th century
(cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_116">§§&nbsp;116</a>, 130, 133).</p>

<p>The objection to the Coppernican scheme that the stars
shewed no such apparent annual motions as the motion
of the earth should produce (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_92">§&nbsp;92</a>) would also
be either answered or strengthened according as improved
methods of observation did or did not reveal the required
motion.</p>

<p>Moreover the <i>Prussian Tables</i>, although more accurate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
than the <i>Alfonsine</i>, hardly claimed, and certainly did not
possess, minute accuracy. Coppernicus had once told
Rheticus that he would be extravagantly pleased if he
could make his theory agree with observation to within 10′;
but as a matter of fact discrepancies of a much more
serious character were noticed from time to time. The
comparatively small number of observations available and
their roughness made it extremely difficult, either to find
the most satisfactory numerical data necessary for the
detailed development of any theory, or to test the theory
properly by comparison of calculated with observed places
of the celestial bodies. Accordingly it became evident to
more than one astronomer that one of the most pressing
needs of the science was that observations should be taken
on as large a scale as possible and with the utmost
attainable accuracy. To meet this need two schools of
observational astronomy, of very unequal excellence, developed
during the latter half of the 16th century, and
provided a mass of material for the use of the astronomers
of the next generation. Fortunately too the same period was
marked by rapid progress in algebra and allied branches of
mathematics. Of the three great inventions which have so
enormously diminished the labour of numerical calculations,
one, the so-called Arabic notation (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_64">§&nbsp;64</a>),
was already familiar, the other two (decimal fractions and
logarithms) were suggested in the 16th century and were
in working order early in the 17th century.</p>

<p><a id="para_97"></a>97. The first important set of observations taken after
the death of Regiomontanus and Walther (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_68">§&nbsp;68</a>)
were due to the energy of the Landgrave <i>William IV.</i> of
Hesse (1532-1592). He was remarkable as a boy for his
love of study, and is reported to have had his interest in
astronomy created or stimulated when he was little more
than 20 by a copy of Apian’s beautiful <i>Astronomicum
Caesareum</i>, the cardboard models in which he caused to be
imitated and developed in metal-work. He went on with
the subject seriously, and in 1561 had an observatory built
at Cassel, which was remarkable as being the first which had
a revolving roof, a device now almost universal. In this he
made extensive observations (chiefly of fixed stars) during
the next six years. The death of his father then compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
him to devote most of his energy to the duties of government,
and his astronomical ardour abated. A few years
later, however (1575), as the result of a short visit from
the talented and enthusiastic young Danish astronomer
Tycho Brahe (<a href="#para_99">§&nbsp;99</a>), he renewed his astronomical work, and
secured shortly afterwards the services of two extremely able
assistants, <i>Christian Rothmann</i> (in 1577) and <i>Joost Bürgi</i>
(in 1579). Rothmann, of whose life extremely little is
known, appears to have been a mathematician and theoretical
astronomer of considerable ability, and was the
author of several improvements in methods of dealing
with various astronomical problems. He was at first a
Coppernican, but shewed his independence by calling
attention to the needless complication introduced by
Coppernicus in resolving the motion of the earth into
<i>three</i> motions when two sufficed (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_79">§&nbsp;79</a>). His
faith in the system was, however, subsequently shaken by
the errors which observation revealed in the <i>Prussian Tables</i>.
Bürgi (1552-1632) was originally engaged by the Landgrave
as a clockmaker, but his remarkable mechanical talents
were soon turned to astronomical account, and it then
appeared that he also possessed unusual ability as a
mathematician.<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p><a id="para_98"></a>98. The chief work of the Cassel Observatory was the
formation of a star catalogue. The positions of stars were
compared with that of the sun, Venus or Jupiter being
used as connecting links, and their positions relatively to
the equator and the first point of Aries (♈) deduced;
allowance was regularly made for the errors due to the
refraction of light by the atmosphere, as well as for the
parallax of the sun, but the most notable new departure
was the use of a clock to record the time of observations
and to measure the motion of the celestial sphere.
The construction of clocks of sufficient accuracy for the
purpose was rendered possible by the mechanical genius
of Bürgi, and in particular by his discovery that a clock
could be regulated by a pendulum, a discovery which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
appears to have taken no steps to publish, and which had
in consequence to be made again independently before it
received general recognition.<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> By 1586 121 stars had been
carefully observed, but a more extensive catalogue which
was to have contained more than a thousand stars was
never finished, owing to the unexpected disappearance of
Rothmann in 1590<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> and the death of the Landgrave two
years later.</p>

<p><a id="para_99"></a>99. The work of the Cassel Observatory was, however,
overshadowed by that carried out nearly at the same time
by <i>Tycho</i> (<i>Tyge</i>) <i>Brahe</i>. He was born in 1546 at Knudstrup
in the Danish province of Scania (now the southern
extremity of Sweden), being the eldest child of a nobleman
who was afterwards governor of Helsingborg Castle. He
was adopted as an infant by an uncle, and brought up
at his country estate. When only 13 he went to the
University of Copenhagen, where he began to study
rhetoric and philosophy, with a view to a political career.
He was, however, very much interested by a small eclipse
of the sun which he saw in 1560, and this stimulus, added
to some taste for the astrological art of casting horoscopes,
led him to devote the greater part of the remaining two
years spent at Copenhagen to mathematics and astronomy.
In 1562 he went on to the University of Leipzig, accompanied,
according to the custom of the time, by a tutor,
who appears to have made persevering but unsuccessful
attempts to induce his pupil to devote himself to law.
Tycho, however, was now as always a difficult person to divert
from his purpose, and went on steadily with his astronomy.
In 1563 he made his first recorded observation, of a close
approach of Jupiter and Saturn, the time of which he noticed
to be predicted a whole month wrong by the <i>Alfonsine
Tables</i> (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_66">§&nbsp;66</a>), while the <i>Prussian Tables</i> (<a href="#para_94">§&nbsp;94</a>)
were several days in error. While at Leipzig he bought
also a few rough instruments, and anticipated one of the
great improvements afterwards carried out systematically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
by trying to estimate and to allow for the errors of his
instruments.</p>

<p>In 1565 Tycho returned to Copenhagen, probably on
account of the war with Sweden which had just broken out,
and stayed about a year, during the course of which he lost
his uncle. He then set out again (1566) on his travels,
and visited Wittenberg, Rostock, Basle, Ingolstadt, Augsburg,
and other centres of learning, thus making acquaintance
with several of the most notable astronomers of Germany.
At Augsburg he met the brothers Hainzel, rich citizens
with a taste for science, for one of whom he designed and
had constructed an enormous <b>quadrant</b> (quarter-circle)
with a radius of about 19 feet, the rim of which was
graduated to single minutes; and he began also here the
construction of his great celestial globe, five feet in diameter,
on which he marked one by one the positions of the stars
as he afterwards observed them.</p>

<p>In 1570 Tycho returned to his father at Helsingborg,
and soon after the death of the latter (1571) went for
a long visit to Steen Bille, an uncle with scientific tastes.
During this visit he seems to have devoted most of his
time to chemistry (or perhaps rather to alchemy), and his
astronomical studies fell into abeyance for a time.</p>

<p><a id="para_100"></a>100. His interest in astronomy was fortunately revived
by the sudden appearance, in November 1572, of a brilliant
new star in the constellation Cassiopeia. Of this Tycho
took a number of extremely careful observations; he noted
the gradual changes in its brilliancy from its first appearance,
when it rivalled Venus at her brightest, down to its final
disappearance 16 months later. He repeatedly measured
its angular distance from the chief stars in Cassiopeia,
and applied a variety of methods to ascertain whether it
had any perceptible parallax (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§§&nbsp;43</a>, 49). No
parallax could be definitely detected, and he deduced accordingly
that the star must certainly be farther off than the moon;
as moreover it had no share in the planetary motions, he
inferred that it must belong to the region of the fixed stars.
To us of to-day this result may appear fairly commonplace,
but most astronomers of the time held so firmly to Aristotle’s
doctrine that the heavens generally, and the region of the
fixed stars in particular, were incorruptible and unchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>able,
that new stars were, like comets, almost universally
ascribed to the higher regions of our own atmosphere.
Tycho wrote an account of the new star, which he was ultimately
induced by his friends to publish (1573), together
with some portions of a calendar for that year which he had
prepared. His reluctance to publish appears to have been
due in great part to a belief that it was unworthy of the
dignity of a Danish nobleman to write books! The
book in question (<i>De Nova ... Stella</i>) compares very
favourably with the numerous other writings which the
star called forth, though it shews that Tycho held the
common beliefs that comets were in our atmosphere, and
that the planets were carried round by solid crystalline
spheres, two delusions which his subsequent work did
much to destroy. He also dealt at some length with the
astrological importance of the star, and the great events
which it foreshadowed, utterances on which Kepler subsequently
made the very sensible criticism that “if that
star did nothing else, at least it announced and produced
a great astronomer.”</p>

<p>In 1574 Tycho was requested to give some astronomical
lectures at the University of Copenhagen, the first of which,
dealing largely with astrology, was printed in 1610, after his
death. When these were finished, he set off again on his
travels (1575). After a short visit to Cassel (<a href="#para_97">§&nbsp;97</a>), during
which he laid the foundation of a lifelong friendship with
the Landgrave, he went on to Frankfort to buy books,
thence to Basle (where he had serious thoughts of settling)
and on to Venice, then back to Augsburg and to Regensburg,
where he obtained a copy of the <i>Commentariolus</i> of
Coppernicus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_73">§&nbsp;73</a>), and finally came home
by way of Saalfeld and Wittenberg.</p>

<p><a id="para_101"></a>101. The next year (1576) was the beginning of a
new epoch in Tycho’s career. The King of Denmark,
Frederick II., who was a zealous patron of science and
literature, determined to provide Tycho with endowments
sufficient to enable him to carry out his astronomical work
in the most effective way. He accordingly gave him for
occupation the little island of Hveen in the Sound (now
belonging to Sweden), promised money for building a
house and observatory, and supplemented the income<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
derived from the rents of the island by an annual payment
of about £100. Tycho paid his first visit to the island in
May, soon set to work building, and had already begun to
make regular observations in his new house before the
end of the year.</p>

<img src="images/i_p133.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>—Uraniborg. From a collection of letters published by Tycho.</div>
</div>
<p><br /><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>
<p>The buildings were as remarkable for their magnificence
as for their scientific utility. Tycho never forgot that he was
a Danish nobleman as well as an astronomer, and built in
a manner suitable to his rank.<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> His chief building (fig. 51),
called Uraniborg (the Castle of the Heavens), was in the
middle of a large square enclosure, laid out as a garden,
the corners of which pointed North, East, South, and West,
and contained several observatories, a library and laboratory,
in addition to living rooms. Subsequently, when the number
of pupils and assistants who came to him had increased,
he erected (1584) a second building, Stjerneborg (Star
Castle), which was remarkable for having underground
observatories. The convenience of being able to carry out
all necessary work on his own premises induced him
moreover to establish workshops, where nearly all his
instruments were made, and afterwards also a printing press
and paper mill. Both at Uraniborg and Stjerneborg not
only the rooms, but even the instruments which were
gradually constructed, were elaborately painted or otherwise
ornamented.</p>

<p><a id="para_102"></a>102. The expenses of the establishment must have been
enormous, particularly as Tycho lived in magnificent style
and probably paid little attention to economy. His income
was derived from various sources, and fluctuated from time
to time, as the King did not merely make him a fixed
annual payment, but added also temporary grants of lands
or money. Amongst other benefactions he received in
1579 one of the canonries of the cathedral of Roskilde,
the endowments of which had been practically secularised
at the Reformation. Unfortunately most of his property
was held on tenures which involved corresponding obligations,
and as he combined the irritability of a genius
with the haughtiness of a mediaeval nobleman, continual
quarrels were the result. Very soon after his arrival at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Hveen his tenants complained of work which he illegally
forced from them; chapel services which his canonry
required him to keep up were neglected, and he entirely
refused to make certain recognised payments to the widow
of the previous canon. Further difficulties arose out of a
lighthouse, the maintenance of which was a duty attached
to one of his estates, but was regularly neglected. Nothing
shews the King’s good feeling towards Tycho more than
the trouble which he took to settle these quarrels, often
ending by paying the sum of money under dispute. Tycho
was moreover extremely jealous of his scientific reputation,
and on more than one occasion broke out into violent
abuse of some assistant or visitor whom he accused of
stealing his ideas and publishing them elsewhere.</p>

<p>In addition to the time thus spent in quarrelling, a good
deal must have been occupied in entertaining the numerous
visitors whom his fame attracted, and who included, in
addition to astronomers, persons of rank such as several
of the Danish royal family and James VI. of Scotland
(afterwards James I. of England).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these distractions, astronomical work
made steady progress, and during the 21 years that Tycho
spent at Hveen he accumulated, with the help of pupils
and assistants, a magnificent series of observations, far
transcending in accuracy and extent anything that had
been accomplished by his predecessors. A good deal of
attention was also given to alchemy, and some to medicine.
He seems to have been much impressed with the idea
of the unity of Nature, and to have been continually
looking out for analogies or actual connection between
the different subjects which he studied.</p>

<p><a id="para_103"></a>103. In 1577 appeared a brilliant comet, which Tycho
observed with his customary care; and, although he had
not at the time his full complement of instruments, his
observations were exact enough to satisfy him that the
comet was at least three times as far off as the moon, and
thus to refute the popular belief, which he had himself
held a few years before (<a href="#para_100">§&nbsp;100</a>), that comets were generated
in our atmosphere. His observations led him also to the
belief that the comet was revolving round the sun, at a
distance from it greater than that of Venus, a conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
which interfered seriously with the common doctrine of
the solid crystalline spheres. He had further opportunities
of observing comets in 1580, 1582, 1585, 1590, and 1596,
and one of his pupils also took observations of a comet
seen in 1593. None of these comets attracted as much
general attention as that of 1577, but Tycho’s observations,
as was natural, gradually improved in accuracy.</p>

<p><a id="para_104"></a>104. The valuable results obtained by means of the new
star of 1572, and by the comets, suggested the propriety of
undertaking a complete treatise on astronomy embodying
these and other discoveries. According to the original
plan, there were to be three preliminary volumes devoted
respectively to the new star, to the comet of 1577, and to
the later comets, while the main treatise was to consist of
several more volumes dealing with the theories of the sun,
moon, and planets. Of this magnificent plan comparatively
little was ever executed. The first volume, called the
<i>Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata</i>, or Introduction
to the New Astronomy, was hardly begun till 1588, and,
although mostly printed by 1592, was never quite finished
during Tycho’s lifetime, and was actually published by
Kepler in 1602. One question, in fact, led to another
in such a way that Tycho felt himself unable to give
a satisfactory account of the star of 1572 without
dealing with a number of preliminary topics, such as the
positions of the fixed stars, precession, and the annual
motion of the sun, each of which necessitated an
elaborate investigation. The second volume, dealing with
the comet of 1577, called <i>De Mundi aetherei recentioribus
Phaenomenis Liber secundus</i> (Second book about recent
appearances in the Celestial World), was finished long
before the first, and copies were sent to friends and
correspondents in 1588, though it was not regularly published
and on sale till 1603. The third volume was never
written, though some material was collected for it, and the
main treatise does not appear to have been touched.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>—Tycho’s system of the world. From his book on the
comet of 1577.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_105"></a>105. The book on the comet of 1577 is of special
interest, as containing an account of Tycho’s system of the
world, which was a compromise between those of Ptolemy
and of Coppernicus. Tycho was too good an astronomer
not to realise many of the simplifications which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Coppernican system introduced, but was unable to answer
two of the serious objections; he regarded any motion of
“the sluggish and heavy earth” as contrary to “physical
principles,” and he objected to the great distance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
stars which the Coppernican system required, because a vast
empty space would be left between them and the planets,
a space which he regarded as wasteful.<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Biblical difficulties<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
also had some weight with him. He accordingly
devised (1583) a new system according to which the five
planets revolved round the sun (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, in fig. 52), while the sun
revolved annually round the earth (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>), and the whole celestial
sphere performed also a daily revolution round the earth.
The system was never worked out in detail, and, like many
compromises, met with little support; Tycho nevertheless
was extremely proud of it, and one of the most violent and
prolonged quarrels of his life (lasting a dozen years) was with
<i>Reymers Bär</i> or <i>Ursus</i> (?-1600), who had communicated
to the Landgrave in 1586 and published two years later a
system of the world very like Tycho’s. Reymers had been
at Hveen for a short time in 1584, and Tycho had no hesitation
in accusing him of having stolen the idea from some
manuscript seen there. Reymers naturally retaliated with
a counter-charge of theft against Tycho. There is, however,
no good reason why the idea should not have occurred
independently to each astronomer; and Reymers made in
some respects a great improvement on Tycho’s scheme by
accepting the daily rotation of the earth, and so doing
away with the daily rotation of the celestial sphere, which
was certainly one of the weakest parts of the Ptolemaic
scheme.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="TYCHO_BRAHE"></a>

<div class="caption">TYCHO BRAHE.
<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 139.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_106"></a>106. The same year (1588) which saw the publication of
Tycho’s book on the comet was also marked by the death
of his patron, Frederick II. The new King Christian was
a boy of 11, and for some years the country was managed
by four leading statesmen. The new government seems to
have been at first quite friendly to Tycho; a large sum was
paid to him for expenses incurred at Hveen, and additional
endowments were promised, but as time went on Tycho’s
usual quarrels with his tenants and others began to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
their effect. In 1594 he lost one of his chief supporters
at court, the Chancellor Kaas, and his successor, as well as
two or three other important officials at court, were not
very friendly, although the stories commonly told of violent
personal animosities appear to have little foundation. As
early as 1591 Tycho had hinted to a correspondent that
he might not remain permanently in Denmark, and in 1594
he began a correspondence with representatives of the
Emperor Rudolph II., who was a patron of science. But
his scientific activity during these years was as great as
ever; and in 1596 he completed the printing of an
extremely interesting volume of scientific correspondence
between the Landgrave, Rothmann, and himself. The
accession of the young King to power in 1596 was at once
followed by the withdrawal of one of Tycho’s estates, and
in the following year the annual payment which had been
made since 1576 was stopped. It is difficult to blame the
King for these economies; he was evidently not as much
interested in astronomy as his father, and consequently regarded
the heavy expenditure at Hveen as an extravagance,
and it is also probable that he was seriously annoyed at
Tycho’s maltreatment of his tenants, and at other pieces of
unruly conduct on his part. Tycho, however, regarded the
forfeiture of his annual pension as the last straw, and left
Hveen early in 1597, taking his more portable property
with him. After a few months spent in Copenhagen, he
took the decisive step of leaving Denmark for Germany,
in return for which action the King deprived him of his
canonry. Tycho thereupon wrote a remonstrance in
which he pointed out the impossibility of carrying on his
work without proper endowments, and offered to return
if his services were properly appreciated. The King,
however, was by this time seriously annoyed, and his reply
was an enumeration of the various causes of complaint
against Tycho which had arisen of late years. Although
Tycho made some more attempts through various friends
to regain royal favour, the breach remained final.</p>

<p><a id="para_107"></a>107. Tycho spent the winter 1597-8 with a friend near
Hamburg, and, while there, issued, under the title of
<i>Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica</i>, a description of his
instruments, together with a short autobiography and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
interesting account of his chief discoveries. About the
same time he circulated manuscript copies of a catalogue
of 1,000 fixed stars, of which only 777 had been properly
observed, the rest having been added hurriedly to make
up the traditional number. The catalogue and the
<i>Mechanica</i> were both intended largely as evidence of his
astronomical eminence, and were sent to various influential
persons. Negotiations went on both with the Emperor
and with the Prince of Orange, and after another year spent
in various parts of Germany, Tycho definitely accepted an
invitation of the Emperor and arrived at Prague in June
1599.</p>

<p><a id="para_108"></a>108. It was soon agreed that he should inhabit the
castle of Benatek, some twenty miles from Prague, where he
accordingly settled with his family and smaller instruments
towards the end of 1599. He at once started observing,
sent one of his sons to Hveen for his larger instruments,
and began looking about for assistants. He secured one of
the most able of his old assistants, and by good fortune
was also able to attract a far greater man, <i>John Kepler</i>, to
whose skilful use of the materials collected by Tycho the
latter owes no inconsiderable part of his great reputation.
Kepler, whose life and work will be dealt with at
length in chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, had recently published his first
important work, the <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i> (<a href="#para_136">§&nbsp;136</a>),
which had attracted the attention of Tycho among others,
and was beginning to find his position at Gratz in Styria
uncomfortable on account of impending religious disputes.
After some hesitation he joined Tycho at Benatek early
in 1600. He was soon set to work at the study of Mars
for the planetary tables which Tycho was then preparing,
and thus acquired special familiarity with the observations
of this planet which Tycho had accumulated. The relations
of the two astronomers were not altogether happy,
Kepler being then as always anxious about money matters,
and the disturbed state of the country rendering it
difficult for Tycho to get payment from the Emperor.
Consequently Kepler very soon left Benatek and returned
to Prague, where he definitely settled after a short visit
to Gratz; Tycho also moved there towards the end of
1600, and they then worked together harmoniously for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the short remainder of Tycho’s life. Though he was
by no means an old man, there were some indications
that his health was failing, and towards the end of 1601
he was suddenly seized with an illness which terminated
fatally after a few days (November 24th). It is characteristic
of his devotion to the great work of his life that
in the delirium which preceded his death he cried out
again and again his hope that his life might not prove to
have been fruitless (<i>Ne frustra vixisse videar</i>).</p>

<p><a id="para_109"></a>109. Partly owing to difficulties between Kepler and
one of Tycho’s family, partly owing to growing political
disturbances, scarcely any use was made of Tycho’s instruments
after his death, and most of them perished during
the Civil Wars in Bohemia. Kepler obtained possession
of his observations; but they have never been published
except in an imperfect form.</p>

<p><a id="para_110"></a>110. Anything like a satisfactory account of Tycho’s
services to astronomy would necessarily deal largely with
technical details of methods of observing, which would
be out of place here. It may, however, be worth while
to attempt to give some general account of his characteristics
as an observer before referring to special discoveries.</p>

<p>Tycho realised more fully than any of his predecessors
the importance of obtaining observations which should not
only be as accurate as possible, but should be taken so
often as to preserve an almost continuous record of the
positions and motions of the celestial bodies dealt with;
whereas the prevailing custom (as illustrated for example
by Coppernicus) was only to take observations now and
then, either when an astronomical event of special interest
such as an eclipse or a conjunction was occurring, or to
supply some particular datum required for a point of theory.
While Coppernicus, as has been already noticed (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>,
<a href="#para_73">§&nbsp;73</a>), only used altogether a few dozen observations in
his book, Tycho—to take one instance—observed the sun
<i>daily</i> for many years, and must therefore have taken some
thousands of observations of this one body, in addition to the
many thousands which he took of other celestial bodies.
It is true that the Arabs had some idea of observing continuously
(cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_57">§&nbsp;57</a>), but they had too little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
speculative power or originality to be able to make much use
of their observations, few of which passed into the hands of
European astronomers. Regiomontanus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_68">§&nbsp;68</a>),
if he had lived, might probably have to a considerable
extent anticipated Tycho, but his short life was
too fully occupied with the study and interpretation of
Greek astronomy for him to accomplish very much in
other departments of the subject. The Landgrave and his
staff, who were in constant communication with Tycho,
were working in the same direction, though on the whole
less effectively. Unlike the Arabs, Tycho was, however,
fully impressed with the idea that observations were only
a means to an end, and that mere observations without
a hypothesis or theory to connect and interpret them were
of little use.</p>

<p>The actual accuracy obtained by Tycho in his observations
naturally varied considerably according to the nature
of the observation, the care taken, and the period of his
career at which it was made. The places which he assigned
to nine stars which were fundamental in his star catalogue
differ from their positions as deduced from the best modern
observations by angles which are in most cases less than 1′,
and in only one case as great as 2′ (this error being chiefly
due to refraction (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_46">§&nbsp;46</a>), Tycho’s knowledge of
which was necessarily imperfect). Other star places were
presumably less accurate, but it will not be far from the truth
if we assume that in most cases the errors in Tycho’s observations
did not exceed 1′ or 2′. Kepler in a famous passage
speaks of an error of 8′ in a planetary observation by
Tycho as impossible. This great increase in accuracy can
only be assigned in part to the size and careful construction
of the instruments used, the characteristics on which the
Arabs and other observers had laid such stress. Tycho
certainly used good instruments, but added very much to
their efficiency, partly by minor mechanical devices, such as
the use of specially constructed “sights” and of a particular
method of graduation,<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and partly by using instruments
capable only of restricted motions, and therefore of much
greater steadiness than instruments which were able to point
to any part of the sky. Another extremely important idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
was that of systematically allowing as far as possible for
the inevitable mechanical imperfections of even the best
constructed instruments, as well as for other permanent
causes of error. It had been long known, for example,
that the refraction of light through the atmosphere had
the effect of slightly raising the apparent places of stars
in the sky. Tycho took a series of observations to ascertain
the amount of this displacement for different parts of
the sky, hence constructed a table of refractions (a very
imperfect one, it is true), and in future observations regularly
allowed for the effect of refraction. Again, it was known
that observations of the sun and planets were liable to be
disturbed by the effect of parallax (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§§&nbsp;43</a>, 49),
though the amount of this correction was uncertain. In
cases where special accuracy was required, Tycho accordingly
observed the body in question at least twice, choosing
positions in which parallax was known to produce nearly
opposite effects, and thus by combining the observations
obtained a result nearly free from this particular source of
error. He was also one of the first to realise fully the
importance of repeating the same observation many times
under different conditions, in order that the various accidental
sources of error in the separate observations should
as far as possible neutralise one another.</p>

<p><a id="para_111"></a>111. Almost every astronomical quantity of importance
was re-determined and generally corrected by him. The
annual motion of the sun’s apogee relative to ♈, for example,
which Coppernicus had estimated at 24″, Tycho fixed at
45″, the modern value being 61″; the length of the year
he determined with an error of less than a second; and he
constructed tables of the motion of the sun which gave its
place to within 1′, previous tables being occasionally 15′ or
20′ wrong. By an unfortunate omission he made no inquiry
into the distance of the sun, but accepted the extremely
inaccurate value which had been handed down, without
substantial alteration, from astronomer to astronomer since
the time of Hipparchus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_41">§&nbsp;41</a>).</p>

<p>In the theory of the moon Tycho made several important
discoveries. He found that the irregularities in its movement
were not fully represented by the equation of the
centre and the evection (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_39">§§&nbsp;39</a>, 48), but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
there was a further irregularity which vanished at opposition
and conjunction as well as at quadratures, but in intermediate
positions of the moon might be as great as 40′.
This irregularity, known as the <b>variation</b>, was, as has been
already mentioned (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_60">§&nbsp;60</a>), very possibly discovered
by Abul Wafa, though it had been entirely lost
subsequently. At a later stage in his career, at latest
during his visit to Wittenberg in 1598-9, Tycho found that
it was necessary to introduce a further small inequality
known as the <b>annual equation</b>, which depended on the
position of the earth in its path round the sun; this, however,
he never completely investigated. He also ascertained
that the inclination of the moon’s orbit to the ecliptic was
not, as had been thought, fixed, but oscillated regularly,
and that the motion of the moon’s nodes (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_40">§&nbsp;40</a>)
was also variable.</p>

<p><a id="para_112"></a>112. Reference has already been made to the star
catalogue. Its construction led to a study of precession,
the amount of which was determined with considerable
accuracy; the same investigation led Tycho to reject the
supposed irregularity in precession which, under the name
of trepidation (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_58">§&nbsp;58</a>), had confused astronomy
for several centuries, but from this time forward rapidly lost
its popularity.</p>

<p>The planets were always a favourite subject of study
with Tycho, but although he made a magnificent series of
observations, of immense value to his successors, he died
before he could construct any satisfactory theory of the
planetary motions. He easily discovered, however, that their
motions deviated considerably from those assigned by any
of the planetary tables, and got as far as detecting some
regularity in these deviations.</p>

<p><a id="para_113"></a>113. To the generation which succeeded Tycho belonged
two of the best known of all astronomers, Galilei and Kepler.
Although they were nearly contemporaries, Galilei having
been born seven years earlier than Kepler, and surviving
him by twelve years, their methods of work and their
contributions to astronomy were so different in character,
and their influence on one another so slight, that it is
convenient to make some departure from strict chronological
order, and to devote this chapter exclusively to
Galilei, leaving Kepler to the next.</p>

<p><i>Galileo Galilei</i> was born in 1564, at Pisa, at that time
in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, on the day of Michel
Angelo’s death and in the year of Shakespeare’s birth.
His father, Vincenzo, was an impoverished member of a
good Florentine family, and was distinguished by his skill
in music and mathematics. Galileo’s talents shewed themselves
early, and although it was originally intended that
he should earn his living by trade, Vincenzo was wise
enough to see that his son’s ability and tastes rendered him
much more fit for a professional career, and accordingly
he sent him in 1581 to study medicine at the University
of Pisa. Here his unusual gifts soon made him conspicuous,
and he became noted in particular for his
unwillingness to accept without question the dogmatic
statements of his teachers, which were based not on direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
evidence, but on the authority of the great writers of the
past. This valuable characteristic, which marked him
throughout his life, coupled with his skill in argument,
earned for him the dislike of some of his professors, and
from his fellow-students the nickname of The Wrangler.</p>

<p><a id="para_114"></a>114. In 1582 his keen observation led to his first scientific
discovery. Happening one day in the Cathedral of
Pisa to be looking at the swinging of a lamp which was
hanging from the roof, he noticed that as the motion
gradually died away and the extent of each oscillation
became less, the time occupied by each oscillation remained
sensibly the same, a result which he verified more precisely
by comparison with the beating of his pulse. Further
thought and trial shewed him that this property was not
peculiar to cathedral lamps, but that any weight hung by
a string (or any other form of pendulum) swung to and fro
in a time which depended only on the length of the string
and other characteristics of the pendulum itself, and not
to any appreciable extent on the way in which it was set
in motion or on the extent of each oscillation. He devised
accordingly an instrument the oscillations of which could
be used while they lasted as a measure of time, and which
was in practice found very useful by doctors for measuring
the rate of a patient’s pulse.</p>

<p><a id="para_115"></a>115. Before very long it became evident that Galilei had
no special taste for medicine, a study selected for him
chiefly as leading to a reasonably lucrative professional
career, and that his real bent was for mathematics and its
applications to experimental science. He had received
little or no formal teaching in mathematics before his second
year at the University, in the course of which he happened
to overhear a lesson on Euclid’s geometry, given at the
Grand Duke’s court, and was so fascinated that he continued
to attend the course, at first surreptitiously, afterwards
openly; his interest in the subject was thereby so much
stimulated, and his aptitude for it was so marked, that he
obtained his father’s consent to abandon medicine in favour
of mathematics.</p>

<p>In 1585, however, poverty compelled him to quit the
University without completing the regular course and
obtaining a degree, and the next four years were spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
chiefly at home, where he continued to read and to think
on scientific subjects. In the year 1586 he wrote his first
known scientific essay,<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> which was circulated in manuscript,
and only printed during the present century.</p>

<p><a id="para_116"></a>116. In 1589 he was appointed for three years to a
professorship of mathematics (including astronomy) at Pisa.
A miserable stipend, equivalent to about five shillings a
week, was attached to the post, but this he was to some
extent able to supplement by taking private pupils.</p>

<p>In his new position Galilei had scope for his remarkable
power of exposition, but far from being content with giving
lectures on traditional lines he also carried out a series of
scientific investigations, important both in themselves and
on account of the novelty in the method of investigation
employed.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to discuss more fully at the end
of this chapter Galilei’s contributions to mechanics and to
scientific method, and merely to refer here briefly to his
first experiments on falling bodies, which were made at this
time. Some were performed by dropping various bodies
from the top of the leaning tower of Pisa, and others by
rolling balls down grooves arranged at different inclinations.
It is difficult to us nowadays, when scientific experiments
are so common, to realise the novelty and importance at
the end of the 16th century of such simple experiments.
The mediaeval tradition of carrying out scientific investigation
largely by the interpretation of texts in Aristotle, Galen,
or other great writers of the past, and by the deduction
of results from general principles which were to be found
in these writers without any fresh appeal to observation,
still prevailed almost undisturbed at Pisa, as elsewhere.
It was in particular commonly asserted, on the authority
of Aristotle, that, the cause of the fall of a heavy body
being its weight, a heavier body must fall faster than a
lighter one and in proportion to its greater weight. It may
perhaps be doubted whether any one before Galilei’s time
had clear enough ideas on the subject to be able to give
a definite answer to such a question as how much farther
a ten-pound weight would fall in a second than a one-pound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
weight; but if so he would probably have said that it would
fall ten times as far, or else that it would require ten times
as long to fall the same distance. To actually try the
experiment, to vary its conditions, so as to remove as many
accidental causes of error as possible, to increase in some
way the time of the fall so as to enable it to be measured
with more accuracy, these ideas, put into practice by Galilei,
were entirely foreign to the prevailing habits of scientific
thought, and were indeed regarded by most of his colleagues
as undesirable if not dangerous innovations. A
few simple experiments were enough to prove the complete
falsity of the current beliefs in this matter, and to establish
that in general bodies of different weights fell nearly the
same distance in the same time, the difference being not
more than could reasonably be ascribed to the resistance
offered by the air.</p>

<p>These and other results were embodied in a tract, which,
like most of Galilei’s earlier writings, was only circulated
in manuscript, the substance of it being first printed in the
great treatise on mechanics which he published towards
the end of his life (<a href="#para_133">§&nbsp;133</a>).</p>

<p>These innovations, coupled with the slight respect that
he was in the habit of paying to those who differed from
him, evidently made Galilei far from popular with his
colleagues at Pisa, and either on this account, or on account
of domestic troubles consequent on the death of his father
(1591), he resigned his professorship shortly before the
expiration of his term of office, and returned to his mother’s
home at Florence.</p>

<p><a id="para_117"></a>117. After a few months spent at Florence he was
appointed, by the influence of a Venetian friend, to a
professorship of mathematics at Padua, which was then in
the territory of the Venetian republic (1592). The appointment
was in the first instance for a period of six years,
and the salary much larger than at Pisa. During the first
few years of Galilei’s career at Padua his activity seems
to have been very great and very varied; in addition to
giving his regular lectures, to audiences which rapidly increased,
he wrote tracts, for the most part not printed at
the time, on astronomy, on mechanics, and on fortification,
and invented a variety of scientific instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>No record exists of the exact time at which he first
adopted the astronomical views of Coppernicus, but he
himself stated that in 1597 he had adopted them some
years before, and had collected arguments in their support.</p>

<p>In the following year his professorship was renewed for
six years with an increased stipend, a renewal which was
subsequently made for six years more, and finally for life,
the stipend being increased on each occasion.</p>

<p>Galilei’s first contribution to astronomical discovery was
made in 1604, when a star appeared suddenly in the constellation
Serpentarius, and was shewn by him to be at
any rate more distant than the planets, a result confirming
Tycho’s conclusions (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_100">§&nbsp;100</a>) that changes take
place in the celestial regions even beyond the planets, and
are by no means confined—as was commonly believed—to
the earth and its immediate surroundings.</p>

<p><a id="para_118"></a>118. By this time Galilei had become famous throughout
Italy, not only as a brilliant lecturer, but also as a
learned and original man of science. The discoveries
which first gave him a European reputation were, however,
the series of telescopic observations made in 1609 and the
following years.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_67">§&nbsp;67</a>) had claimed to have devised
a combination of lenses enabling distant objects to be
seen as if they were near; a similar invention was probably
made by our countryman <i>Leonard Digges</i> (who died about
1571), and was described also by the Italian <i>Porta</i> in 1558.
If such an instrument was actually made by any one of the
three, which is not certain, the discovery at any rate
attracted no attention and was again lost. The effective
discovery of the telescope was made in Holland in 1608
by <i>Hans Lippersheim</i> (?-1619), a spectacle-maker of Middleburg,
and almost simultaneously by two other Dutchmen,
but whether independently or not it is impossible to say.
Early in the following year the report of the invention
reached Galilei, who, though without any detailed information
as to the structure of the instrument, succeeded after
a few trials in arranging two lenses—one convex and one
concave—in a tube in such a way as to enlarge the
apparent size of an object looked at; his first instrument
made objects appear three times nearer, consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
three times greater (in breadth and height), and he was
soon able to make telescopes which in the same way
magnified thirty-fold.</p>

<p>That the new instrument might be applied to celestial
as well as to terrestrial objects was a fairly obvious idea,
which was acted on almost at once by the English mathematician
<i>Thomas Harriot</i> (1560-1621), by <i>Simon Marius</i>
(1570-1624) in Germany, and by Galilei. That the credit
of first using the telescope for astronomical purposes is
almost invariably attributed to Galilei, though his first
observations were in all probability slightly later in date
than those of Harriot and Marius, is to a great extent
justified by the persistent way in which he examined object
after object, whenever there seemed any reasonable prospect
of results following, by the energy and acuteness with which
he followed up each clue, by the independence of mind
with which he interpreted his observations, and above all
by the insight with which he realised their astronomical
importance.</p>

<p><a id="para_119"></a>119. His first series of telescopic discoveries were published
early in 1610 in a little book called <i>Sidereus Nuncius</i>,
or <i>The Sidereal Messenger</i>. His first observations at
once threw a flood of light on the nature of our nearest
celestial neighbour, the moon. It was commonly believed
that the moon, like the other celestial bodies, was perfectly
smooth and spherical, and the cause of the familiar dark
markings on the surface was quite unknown.<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>—One of Galilei’s drawings of the moon. From the
<i>Sidereus Nuncius</i>.
[<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 150.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p>Galilei discovered at once a number of smaller markings,
both bright and dark (fig. 53), and recognised many of
the latter as shadows of lunar mountains cast by the
sun; and further identified bright spots seen near the
boundary of the illuminated and dark portions of the moon
as mountain-tops just catching the light of the rising or
setting sun, while the surrounding lunar area was still in
darkness. Moreover, with characteristic ingenuity and love
of precision, he calculated from observations of this nature
the height of some of the more conspicuous lunar moun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>tains,
the largest being estimated by him to be about four
miles high, a result agreeing closely with modern estimates
of the greatest height on the moon. The large dark spots
he explained (erroneously) as possibly caused by water,
though he evidently had less confidence in the correctness
of the explanation than some of his immediate scientific
successors, by whom the name of <b>seas</b> was given to
these spots (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_153">§&nbsp;153</a>). He noticed also the
absence of clouds. Apart however from details, the really
significant results of his observations were that the moon
was in many important respects similar to the earth, that
the traditional belief in its perfectly spherical form had
to be abandoned, and that so far the received doctrine of
the sharp distinction to be drawn between things celestial
and things terrestrial was shewn to be without justification;
the importance of this in connection with the Coppernican
view that the earth, instead of being unique, was one of
six planets revolving round the sun, needs no comment.</p>

<p>One of Galilei’s numerous scientific opponents<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> attempted
to explain away the apparent contradiction between the old
theory and the new observations by the ingenious suggestion
that the apparent valleys in the moon were in reality
filled with some <i>invisible</i> crystalline material, so that the
moon was in fact perfectly spherical. To this Galilei
replied that the idea was so excellent that he wished to
extend its application, and accordingly maintained that
the moon had on it mountains of this same invisible substance,
at least ten times as high as any which he had
observed.</p>

<p><a id="para_120"></a>120. The telescope revealed also the existence of an
immense number of stars too faint to be seen by the
unaided eye; Galilei saw, for example, 36 stars in the
Pleiades, which to an ordinary eye consist of six only.
Portions of the Milky Way and various nebulous patches
of light were also discovered to consist of multitudes of
faint stars clustered together; in the cluster Præsepe (in
the Crab), for example, he counted 40 stars.</p>

<p><a id="para_121"></a>121. By far the most striking discovery announced in the
<i>Sidereal Messenger</i> was that of the bodies now known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the moons or satellites of Jupiter. On January 7th, 1610,
Galilei turned his telescope on to Jupiter, and noticed
three faint stars which caught his attention on account of
their closeness to the planet and their arrangement nearly
in a straight line with it. He looked again next night, and
noticed that they had changed their positions relatively
to Jupiter, but that the change did not seem to be such
as could result from Jupiter’s own motion, if the new bodies
were fixed stars. Two nights later he was able to confirm
this conclusion, and to infer that the new bodies were not
fixed stars, but moving bodies which accompanied Jupiter
in his movements. A fourth body was noticed on
January 13th, and the motions of all four were soon recognised
by Galilei as being motions of revolution round
Jupiter as a centre. With characteristic thoroughness he
watched the motions of the new bodies night after night,
and by the date of the publication of his book had already
estimated with very fair accuracy their periods of revolution
round Jupiter, which ranged between about 42 hours and
17 days; and he continued to watch their motions for
years.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>—Jupiter and its satellites as seen on Jan. 7, 1610.
From the <i>Sidereus Nuncius</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>The new bodies were at first called by their discoverer
Medicean planets, in honour of his patron Cosmo de
Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany; but it was evident
that bodies revolving round a planet, as the planets themselves
revolved round the sun, formed a new class of bodies
distinct from the known planets, and the name of <b>satellite</b>,
suggested by Kepler as applicable to the new bodies as
well as to the moon, has been generally accepted.</p>

<p>The discovery of Jupiter’s satellites shewed the falsity
of the old doctrine that the earth was the only centre of
motion; it tended, moreover, seriously to discredit the
infallibility of Aristotle and Ptolemy, who had clearly no
knowledge of the existence of such bodies; and again
those who had difficulty in believing that Venus and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Mercury could revolve round an apparently moving body,
the sun, could not but have their doubts shaken when
shewn the new satellites evidently performing a motion
of just this character; and—most important consequence
of all—the very real mechanical difficulty involved in the
Coppernican conception of the moon revolving round the
moving earth and not dropping behind was at any rate
shewn not to be insuperable, as Jupiter’s satellites succeeded
in performing a precisely similar feat.</p>

<p>The same reasons which rendered Galilei’s telescopic
discoveries of scientific importance made them also objectionable
to the supporters of the old views, and they were
accordingly attacked in a number of pamphlets, some of
which are still extant and possess a certain amount of
interest. One <i>Martin Horky</i>, for example, a young German
who had studied under Kepler, published a pamphlet in
which, <i>after</i> proving to his own satisfaction that the satellites
of Jupiter did not exist, he discussed at some length
what they were, what they were like, and why they existed.
Another writer gravely argued that because the human
body had seven openings in it—the eyes, ears, nostrils, and
mouth—therefore by analogy there must be seven planets
(the sun and moon being included) and no more. However,
confirmation by other observers was soon obtained
and the pendulum even began to swing in the opposite
direction, a number of new satellites of Jupiter being
announced by various observers. None of these, however,
turned out to be genuine, and Galilei’s four remained the
only known satellites of Jupiter till a few years ago
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_295">§&nbsp;295</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_122"></a>122. The reputation acquired by Galilei by the publication
of the <i>Messenger</i> enabled him to bring to a satisfactory
issue negotiations which he had for some time been carrying
on with the Tuscan court. Though he had been well
treated by the Venetians, he had begun to feel the burden
of regular teaching somewhat irksome, and was anxious to
devote more time to research and to writing. A republic
could hardly be expected to provide him with such a
sinecure as he wanted, and he accordingly accepted in the
summer of 1610 an appointment as professor at Pisa, and
also as “First Philosopher and Mathematician” to the Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Duke of Tuscany, with a handsome salary and no definite
duties attached to either office.</p>

<p><a id="para_123"></a>123. Shortly before leaving Padua he turned his telescope
on to Saturn, and observed that the planet appeared to
consist of three parts, as shewn in the first drawing of
fig. 67 (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_154">§&nbsp;154</a>). On subsequent occasions,
however, he failed to see more than the central body, and
the appearances of Saturn continued to present perplexing
variations, till the mystery was solved by Huygens in 1655
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_154">§&nbsp;154</a>).</p>

<p>The first discovery made at Florence (October 1610) was
that Venus, which to the naked eye appears to vary very
much in brilliancy but not in shape, was in reality at times
crescent-shaped like the new moon and passed through
phases similar to some of those of the moon. This shewed
that Venus was, like the moon, a dark body in itself, deriving
its light from the sun; so that its similarity to the earth
was thereby made more evident.</p>

<p><a id="para_124"></a>124. The discovery of dark spots on the sun completed
this series of telescopic discoveries. According to his own
statement Galilei first saw them towards the end of 1610,<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
but apparently paid no particular attention to them at the
time; and, although he shewed them as a matter of
curiosity to various friends, he made no formal announcement
of the discovery till May 1612, by which time the
same discovery had been made independently by Harriot
(<a href="#para_118">§&nbsp;118</a>) in England, by <i>John Fabricius</i> (1587-? 1615) in
Holland, and by the Jesuit <i>Christopher Scheiner</i> (1575-1650)
in Germany, and had been published by Fabricius (June
1611). As a matter of fact dark spots had been seen with
the naked eye long before, but had been generally supposed
to be caused by the passage of Mercury in front of the sun.
The presence on the sun of such blemishes as black spots,
the “mutability” involved in their changes in form and
position, and their formation and subsequent disappearance,
were all distasteful to the supporters of the old views,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
according to which celestial bodies were perfect and unchangeable.
The fact, noticed by all the early observers,
that the spots appeared to move across the face of the sun
from the eastern to the western side (<i>i.e.</i> roughly from left
to right, as seen at midday by an observer in our latitudes),
gave at first sight countenance to the view, championed by
Scheiner among others, that the spots might really be small
planets revolving round the sun, and appearing as dark
objects whenever they passed between the sun and the
observer. In three letters to his friend Welser, a merchant
prince of Augsburg, written in 1612 and published in the
following year,<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Galilei, while giving a full account of his
observations, gave a crushing refutation of this view; proved
that the spots must be on or close to the surface of the
sun, and that the motions observed were exactly such as
would result if the spots were attached to the sun, and it
revolved on an axis in a period of about a month; and
further, while disclaiming any wish to speak confidently,
called attention to several of their points of resemblance
to clouds.</p>

<p>One of his arguments against Scheiner’s views is so
simple and at the same time so convincing, that it may
be worth while to reproduce it as an illustration of Galilei’s
method, though the controversy itself is quite dead.</p>

<p>Galilei noticed, namely, that while a spot took about
fourteen days to cross from one side of the sun to the
other, and this time was the same whether the spot passed
through the centre of the sun’s disc, or along a shorter
path at some distance from it, its rate of motion was by
no means uniform, but that the spot’s motion always
appeared much slower when near the edge of the sun
than when near the centre. This he recognised as an
effect of foreshortening, which would result if, and only if,
the spot were near the sun.</p>

<p>If, for example, in the figure, the circle represent a
section of the sun by a plane through the observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> be points taken at equal distances along
the surface of the sun, so as to represent the positions
of an object on the sun at equal intervals of time, on
the assumption that the sun revolves uniformly, then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
apparent motion from <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, as seen by the observer
at <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, is measured by the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A O B</span>, and is obviously
much less than that from <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, measured by the angle
<span class="smcap lowercase">D O E</span>, and consequently an object attached to the sun
must appear to move more slowly from <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <i>i.e.</i> near
the sun’s edge, than from <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, near the centre. On the
other hand, if the spot be a body revolving round the sun
at some distance from it, <i>e.g.</i> along the dotted circle <i>c d e</i>,
then if <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> be taken at equal distances from one another,
the apparent motion from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, measured again by the
angle <i>c</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> <i>d</i>, is only very slightly less than that from <i>d</i> to <i>e</i>,
measured by the angle <i>d</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> <i>e</i>. Moreover, it required only
a simple calculation, performed by Galilei in several cases,
to express these results in a numerical shape, and so to
infer from the actual observations that the spots could not
be more than a very moderate distance from the sun. The
only escape from this conclusion was by the assumption
that the spots, if they were bodies revolving round the sun,
moved irregularly, in such a way as always to be moving
fastest when they happened to be between the centre of
the sun and the earth, whatever the earth’s position might
be at the time, a procedure for which, on the one hand,
no sort of reason could be given, and which, on the other,
was entirely out of harmony with the uniformity to which
mediæval astronomy clung so firmly.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span>—Galilei’s proof that sun-spots are not planets.</div>
</div>

<p>The rotation of the sun about an axis, thus established,
might evidently have been used as an argument in support
of the view that the earth also had such a motion, but,
as far as I am aware, neither Galilei nor any contemporary
noticed the analogy. Among other facts relating to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
spots observed by Galilei were the greater darkness of the
central parts, some of his drawings (see fig. 55) shewing,
like most modern drawings, a fairly well-marked line of
division between the central part (or <b>umbra</b>) and the less
dark fringe (or <b>penumbra</b>) surrounding it; he noticed also
that spots frequently appeared in groups, that the members
of a group changed their positions relatively to one another,
that individual spots changed their size and shape considerably
during their lifetime, and that spots were usually
most plentiful in two regions on each side of the sun’s
equator, corresponding roughly to the tropics on our own
globe, and were never seen far beyond these limits.</p>

<p>Similar observations were made by other telescopists,
and to Scheiner belongs the credit of fixing, with considerably
more accuracy than Galilei, the position of the sun’s
axis and equator and the time of its rotation.</p>

<p><a id="para_125"></a>125. The controversy with Scheiner as to the nature
of spots unfortunately developed into a personal quarrel
as to their respective claims to the discovery of spots,
a controversy which made Scheiner his bitter enemy, and
probably contributed not a little to the hostility with which
Galilei was henceforward regarded by the Jesuits. Galilei’s
uncompromising championship of the new scientific ideas,
the slight respect which he shewed for established and
traditional authority, and the biting sarcasms with which
he was in the habit of greeting his opponents, had won
for him a large number of enemies in scientific and
philosophic circles, particularly among the large party
who spoke in the name of Aristotle, although, as Galilei
was never tired of reminding them, their methods of
thought and their conclusions would in all probability
have been rejected by the great Greek philosopher if he
had been alive.</p>

<p>It was probably in part owing to his consciousness of a
growing hostility to his views, both in scientific and in
ecclesiastical circles, that Galilei paid a short visit to Rome
in 1611, when he met with a most honourable reception
and was treated with great friendliness by several cardinals
and other persons in high places.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he soon began to be drawn into a controversy
as to the relative validity in scientific matters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
observation and reasoning on the one hand, and of the
authority of the Church and the Bible on the other, a
controversy which began to take shape about this time and
which, though its battle-field has shifted from science to
science, has lasted almost without interruption till modern
times.</p>

<p>In 1611 was published a tract maintaining Jupiter’s
satellites to be unscriptural. In 1612 Galilei consulted
Cardinal Conti as to the astronomical teaching of the Bible,
and obtained from him the opinion that the Bible appeared
to discountenance both the Aristotelian doctrine of the
immutability of the heavens and the Coppernican doctrine
of the motion of the earth. A tract of Galilei’s on floating
bodies, published in 1612, roused fresh opposition, but on
the other hand Cardinal Barberini (who afterwards, as
Urban VIII., took a leading part in his persecution)
specially thanked him for a presentation copy of the book
on sun-spots, in which Galilei, for the first time, clearly
proclaimed in public his adherence to the Coppernican
system. In the same year (1613) his friend and follower,
Father Castelli, was appointed professor of mathematics
at Pisa, with special instructions not to lecture on the
motion of the earth. Within a few months Castelli was
drawn into a discussion on the relations of the Bible to
astronomy, at the house of the Grand Duchess, and quoted
Galilei in support of his views; this caused Galilei to
express his opinions at some length in a letter to Castelli,
which was circulated in manuscript at the court. To this
a Dominican preacher, Caccini, replied a few months
afterwards by a violent sermon on the text, “Ye Galileans,
why stand ye gazing up into heaven?”<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and in 1615
Galilei was secretly denounced to the Inquisition on the
strength of the letter to Castelli and other evidence. In
the same year he expanded the letter to Castelli into a
more elaborate treatise, in the form of a <i>Letter to the Grand
Duchess Christine</i>, which was circulated in manuscript, but
not printed till 1636. The discussion of the bearing of
particular passages of the Bible (<i>e.g.</i> the account of the
miracle of Joshua) on the Ptolemaic and Coppernican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
systems has now lost most of its interest; it may, however,
be worth noticing that on the more general question Galilei
quotes with approval the saying of Cardinal Baronius,
“That the intention of the Holy Ghost is to teach us not
how the heavens go, but how to go to heaven,”<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> and the
following passage gives a good idea of the general tenor
of his argument:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Methinks, that in the Discussion of Natural Problemes we
ought not to begin at the authority of places of Scripture; but
at Sensible Experiments and Necessary Demonstrations. For
... Nature being inexorable and immutable, and never passing
the bounds of the Laws assigned her, as one that nothing careth,
whether her abstruse reasons and methods of operating be or
be not exposed to the capacity of men; I conceive that that
concerning Natural Effects, which either sensible experience
sets before our eyes, or Necessary Demonstrations do prove unto
us, ought not, upon any account, to be called into question,
much less condemned upon the testimony of Texts of Scripture,
which may under their words, couch senses seemingly contrary
thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_126"></a>126. Meanwhile his enemies had become so active that
Galilei thought it well to go to Rome at the end of 1615
to defend his cause. Early in the next year a body of
theologians known as the Qualifiers of the Holy Office
(Inquisition), who had been instructed to examine certain
Coppernican doctrines, reported:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That the doctrine that the sun was the centre of the world
and immoveable was false and absurd, formally heretical and
contrary to Scripture, whereas the doctrine that the earth was
not the centre of the world but moved, and has further a daily
motion, was philosophically false and absurd and theologically
at least erroneous.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In consequence of this report it was decided to censure
Galilei, and the Pope accordingly instructed Cardinal
Bellarmine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> “to summon Galilei and admonish him to
abandon the said opinion,” which the Cardinal did.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
Immediately afterwards a decree was issued condemning
the opinions in question and placing on the well-known
<i>Index of Prohibited Books</i> three books containing Coppernican
views, of which the <i>De Revolutionibus</i> of Coppernicus
and another were only suspended “until they should
be corrected,” while the third was altogether prohibited.
The necessary corrections to the <i>De Revolutionibus</i> were
officially published in 1620, and consisted only of a few
alterations which tended to make the essential principles;
of the book appear as mere mathematical hypotheses,
convenient for calculation. Galilei seems to have been
on the whole well satisfied with the issue of the inquiry,
as far as he was personally concerned, and after obtaining
from Cardinal Bellarmine a certificate that he had neither
abjured his opinions nor done penance for them, stayed
on in Rome for some months to shew that he was in
good repute there.</p>

<p><a id="para_127"></a>127. During the next few years Galilei, who was now
more than fifty, suffered a good deal from ill-health and
was comparatively inactive. He carried on, however, a
correspondence with the Spanish court on a method of
ascertaining the longitude at sea by means of Jupiter’s
satellites. The essential problem in finding the longitude
is to obtain the time as given by the sun at the required
place and also that at some place the longitude of which
is known. If, for example, midday at Rome occurs an
hour earlier than in London, the sun takes an hour to
travel from the meridian of Rome to that of London, and
the longitude of Rome is 15° east of that of London.
At sea it is easy to ascertain the local time, <i>e.g.</i> by
observing when the sun is highest in the sky, but the
great difficulty, felt in Galilei’s time and long afterwards
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_197">§§&nbsp;197</a>, 226), was that of ascertaining the time at
some standard place. Clocks were then, and long afterwards,
not to be relied upon to keep time accurately during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
a long ocean voyage, and some astronomical means of
determining the time was accordingly wanted. Galilei’s
idea was that if the movements of Jupiter’s satellites, and
in particular the eclipses which constantly occurred when
a satellite passed into Jupiter’s shadow, could be predicted,
then a table could be prepared giving the times, according
to some standard place, say Rome, at which the eclipses
would occur, and a sailor by observing the local time
of an eclipse and comparing it with the time given in
the table could ascertain by how much his longitude
differed from that of Rome. It is, however, doubtful
whether the movements of Jupiter’s satellites could at that
time be predicted accurately enough to make the method
practically useful, and in any case the negotiations came
to nothing.</p>

<p>In 1618 three comets appeared, and Galilei was soon
drawn into a controversy on the subject with a Jesuit
of the name of Grassi. The controversy was marked by
the personal bitterness which was customary, and soon
developed so as to include larger questions of philosophy
and astronomy. Galilei’s final contribution to it was
published in 1623 under the title <i>Il Saggiatore</i> (The
Assayer), which dealt incidentally with the Coppernican
theory, though only in the indirect way which the edict
of 1616 rendered necessary. In a characteristic passage,
for example, Galilei says:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Since the motion attributed to the earth, which I, as a pious
and Catholic person, consider most false, and not to exist,
accommodates itself so well to explain so many and such
different phenomena, I shall not feel sure ... that, false as it
is, it may not just as deludingly correspond with the phenomena
of comets”;</p></blockquote>

<p>and again, in speaking of the rival systems of Coppernicus
and Tycho, he says:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Then as to the Copernican hypothesis, if by the good
fortune of us Catholics we had not been freed from error
and our blindness illuminated by the Highest Wisdom, I do
not believe that such grace and good fortune could have
been obtained by means of the reasons and observations given
by Tycho.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>Although in scientific importance the <i>Saggiatore</i> ranks
far below many others of Galilei’s writings, it had a great
reputation as a piece of brilliant controversial writing, and
notwithstanding its thinly veiled Coppernicanism, the new
Pope, Urban VIII., to whom it was dedicated, was so much
pleased with it that he had it read aloud to him at meals.
The book must, however, have strengthened the hands
of Galilei’s enemies, and it was probably with a view to
counteracting their influence that he went to Rome next
year, to pay his respects to Urban and congratulate him
on his recent elevation. The visit was in almost every
way a success; Urban granted to him several friendly
interviews, promised a pension for his son, gave him several
presents, and finally dismissed him with a letter of special
recommendation to the new Grand Duke of Tuscany, who
had shewn some signs of being less friendly to Galilei
than his father. On the other hand, however, the Pope
refused to listen to Galilei’s request that the decree of 1616
should be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a id="para_128"></a>128. Galilei now set seriously to work on the great
astronomical treatise, the <i>Dialogue on the Two Chief
Systems of the World, the Ptolemaic and Coppernican</i>,
which he had had in mind as long ago as 1610, and in
which he proposed to embody most of his astronomical
work and to collect all the available evidence bearing on
the Coppernican controversy. The form of a dialogue was
chosen, partly for literary reasons, and still more because
it enabled him to present the Coppernican case as strongly
as he wished through the mouths of some of the speakers,
without necessarily identifying his own opinions with theirs.
The manuscript was almost completed in 1629, and in the
following year Galilei went to Rome to obtain the necessary
licence for printing it. The censor had some alterations
made and then gave the desired permission for printing at
Rome, on condition that the book was submitted to him
again before being finally printed off. Soon after Galilei’s
return to Florence the plague broke out, and quarantine
difficulties rendered it almost necessary that the book
should be printed at Florence instead of at Rome. This
required a fresh licence, and the difficulty experienced in
obtaining it shewed that the Roman censor was getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
more and more doubtful about the book. Ultimately,
however, the introduction and conclusion having been sent
to Rome for approval and probably to some extent rewritten
there, and the whole work having been approved
by the Florentine censor, the book was printed and the
first copies were ready early in 1632, bearing both the
Roman and the Florentine <i>imprimatur</i>.</p>

<p><a id="para_129"></a>129. The Dialogue extends over four successive days,
and is carried on by three speakers, of whom Salviati is a
Coppernican and Simplicio an Aristotelian philosopher,
while Sagredo is avowedly neutral, but on almost every
occasion either agrees with Salviati at once or is easily
convinced by him, and frequently joins in casting ridicule
upon the arguments of the unfortunate Simplicio. Though
many of the arguments have now lost their immediate
interest, and the book is unduly long, it is still very readable,
and the specimens of scholastic reasoning put into
the mouth of Simplicio and the refutation of them by
the other speakers strike the modern reader as excellent
fooling.</p>

<p>Many of the arguments used had been published by
Galilei in earlier books, but gain impressiveness and cogency
by being collected and systematically arranged. The
Aristotelian dogma of the immutability of the celestial
bodies is once more belaboured, and shewn to be not
only inconsistent with observations of the moon, the sun,
comets, and new stars, but to be in reality incapable of
being stated in a form free from obscurity and self-contradiction.
The evidence in favour of the earth’s motion
derived from the existence of Jupiter’s satellites and from
the undoubted phases of Venus, from the suspected phases
of Mercury and from the variations in the apparent size of
Mars, are once more insisted on. The greater simplicity
of the Coppernican explanation of the daily motion of the
celestial sphere and of the motion of the planets is forcibly
urged and illustrated in detail. It is pointed out that on
the Coppernican hypothesis all motions of revolution or
rotation take place in the same direction (from west to
east), whereas the Ptolemaic hypothesis requires some
to be in one direction, some in another. Moreover the
apparent daily motion of the stars, which appears simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
enough if the stars are regarded as rigidly attached to a
material sphere, is shewn in a quite different aspect if,
as even Simplicio admits, no such sphere exists, and each
star moves in some sense independently. A star near the
pole must then be supposed to move far more slowly than
one near the equator, since it describes a much smaller
circle in the same time; and further—an argument very
characteristic of Galilei’s ingenuity in drawing conclusions
from known facts—owing to the precession of the equinoxes
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_84">§&nbsp;84</a>) and the consequent change
of the position of the pole among the stars, some of those
stars which in Ptolemy’s time were describing very small
circles, and therefore moving slowly, must now be describing
large ones at a greater speed, and <i>vice versa</i>. An extremely
complicated adjustment of motions becomes therefore
necessary to account for observations which Coppernicus
explained adequately by the rotation of the earth and a
simple displacement of its axis of rotation.</p>

<p>Salviati deals also with the standing difficulty that the
annual motion of the earth ought to cause a corresponding
apparent motion of the stars, and that if the stars be
assumed so far off that this motion is imperceptible, then
some of the stars themselves must be at least as large as
the earth’s orbit round the sun. Salviati points out that
the apparent or angular magnitudes of the fixed stars,
avowedly difficult to determine, are in reality almost entirely
illusory, being due in great part to an optical effect known
as <b>irradiation</b>, in virtue of which a bright object always
tends to appear enlarged;<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and that there is in consequence
no reason to suppose the stars nearly as large as they might
otherwise be thought to be. It is suggested also that the
most promising way of detecting the annual motion of stars
resulting from the motion of the earth would be by
observing the relative displacement of two stars close
together in the sky (and therefore nearly in the same direction),
of which one might be presumed from its greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
brightness to be nearer than the other. It is, for example,
evident that if, in the figure, <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E′</span> represent two positions of
the earth in its path round the sun, and <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> two stars at
different distances, but nearly in the same direction, then
to the observer at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> the star <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> appears to the left of <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
whereas six months afterwards, when the observer is at <span class="smcap lowercase">E′</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> appears to the right of <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. Such a motion of one star with
respect to another close to it would be much more easily
observed than an alteration of the same amount in the
distance of the star from some standard point such as the
pole. Salviati points out that accurate observations of
this kind had not been made, and that the telescope might
be of assistance for the purpose. This method, known as
the <b>double-star</b> or <b>differential method of parallax</b>, was in
fact the first to lead—two centuries later—to a successful
detection of the motion in question (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_278">§&nbsp;278</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><a id="para_130"></a>130. Entirely new ground is broken in the <i>Dialogue</i>
when Galilei’s discoveries of the laws of motion of bodies
are applied to the problem of the earth’s motion. His
great discovery, which threw an entirely new light on the
mechanics of the solar system, was substantially the law
afterwards given by Newton as the first of his three laws
of motion, in the form: <i>Every body continues in its state of
rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, except in so far
as it is compelled by force applied to it to change that state.</i>
Putting aside for the present any discussion of <i>force</i>, a
conception first made really definite by Newton, and only
imperfectly grasped by Galilei, we may interpret this law
as meaning that a body has no more inherent tendency to
diminish its motion or to stop than it has to increase its
motion or to start, and that any alteration in either the
speed or the direction of a body’s motion is to be explained
by the action on it of some other body, or at any rate by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
some other assignable cause. Thus a stone thrown along
a road comes to rest on account of the friction between
it and the ground, a ball thrown up into the air ascends
more and more slowly and then falls to the ground on account
of that attraction of the earth on it which we call its
weight. As it is impossible to entirely isolate a body from
all others, we cannot experimentally realise the state of
things in which a body goes on moving indefinitely in the
same direction and at the same rate; it may, however,
be shewn that the more we remove a body from the
influence of others, the less alteration is there in its motion.
The law is therefore, like most scientific laws, an abstraction
referring to a state of things to which we may
approximate in nature. Galilei introduces the idea in the
Dialogue by means of a ball on a smooth inclined plane.
If the ball is projected upwards, its motion is gradually
retarded; if downwards, it is continually accelerated. This
is true if the plane is fairly smooth—like a well-planed
plank—and the inclination of the plane not very small.
If we imagine the experiment performed on an ideal plane,
which is supposed <i>perfectly</i> smooth, we should expect the
same results to follow, however small the inclination of
the plane. Consequently, if the plane were quite level,
so that there is no distinction between up and down, we
should expect the motion to be neither retarded nor
accelerated, but to continue without alteration. Other
more familiar examples are also given of the tendency
of a body, when once in motion, to continue in motion,
as in the case of a rider whose horse suddenly stops, or of
bodies in the cabin of a moving ship which have no tendency
to lose the motion imparted to them by the ship, so that,
<i>e.g.</i>, a body falls down to all appearances exactly as if the
rest of the cabin were at rest, and therefore, in reality,
while falling retains the forward motion which it shares
with the ship and its contents. Salviati states also that—contrary
to general belief—a stone dropped from the masthead
of a ship in motion falls at the foot of the mast, not
behind it, but there is no reference to the experiment
having been actually performed.</p>

<p>This mechanical principle being once established, it
becomes easy to deal with several common objections to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the supposed motion of the earth. The case of a stone
dropped from the top of a tower, which if the earth be
in reality moving rapidly from west to east might be
expected to fall to the west in its descent, is easily shewn
to be exactly parallel to the case of a stone dropped from
the masthead of a ship in motion. The motion towards
the east, which the stone when resting on the tower shares
with the tower and the earth, is not destroyed in its
descent, and it is therefore entirely in accordance with the
Coppernican theory that the stone should fall as it does at
the foot of the tower.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Similarly, the fact that the clouds,
the atmosphere in general, birds flying in it, and loose
objects on the surface of the earth, shew no tendency to
be left behind as the earth moves rapidly eastward, but
are apparently unaffected by the motion of the earth, is
shewn to be exactly parallel to the fact that the flies in
a ship’s cabin and the loose objects there are in no way
affected by the uniform onward motion of the ship (though
the irregular motions of pitching and rolling do affect them).
The stock objection that a cannon-ball shot westward
should, on the Coppernican hypothesis, carry farther than
one shot eastward under like conditions, is met in the
same way; but it is further pointed out that, owing to
the imperfection of gunnery practice, the experiment could
not really be tried accurately enough to yield any decisive
result.</p>

<p>The most unsatisfactory part of the <i>Dialogue</i> is the
fourth day’s discussion, on the tides, of which Galilei
suggests with great confidence an explanation based merely
on the motion of the earth, while rejecting with scorn the
suggestion of Kepler and others—correct as far as it
went—that they were caused by some influence emanating
from the moon. It is hardly to be wondered at that the
rudimentary mechanical and mathematical knowledge at
Galilei’s command should not have enabled him to deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
correctly with a problem of which the vastly more powerful
resources of modern science can only give an imperfect
solution (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_248">§&nbsp;248</a>, and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_292">§&nbsp;292</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_131"></a>131. The book as a whole was in effect, though not in
form, a powerful—indeed unanswerable—plea for Coppernicanism.
Galilei tried to safeguard his position, partly
by the use of dialogue, and partly by the very remarkable
introduction, which was not only read and approved by the
licensing authorities, but was in all probability in part
the composition of the Roman censor and of the Pope.
It reads to us like a piece of elaborate and thinly veiled
irony, and it throws a curious light on the intelligence
or on the seriousness of the Pope and the censor, that
they should have thus approved it:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Judicious reader, there was published some years since in
<i>Rome</i> a salutiferous Edict, that, for the obviating of the dangerous
Scandals of the present Age, imposed a reasonable Silence upon
the Pythagorean Opinion of the Mobility of the Earth. There
want not such as unadvisedly affirm, that the Decree was not
the production of a sober Scrutiny, but of an informed passion;
and one may hear some mutter that Consultors altogether
ignorant of Astronomical observations ought not to clipp the
wings of speculative wits with rash prohibitions. My zeale
cannot keep silence when I hear these inconsiderate complaints.
I thought fit, as being thoroughly acquainted with that prudent
Determination, to appear openly upon the Theatre of the World
as a Witness of the naked Truth. I was at that time in <i>Rome</i>,
and had not only the audiences, but applauds of the most
Eminent Prelates of that Court; nor was that Decree published
without Previous Notice given me thereof. Therefore it is my
resolution in the present case to give Foreign Nations to see,
that this point is as well understood in <i>Italy</i>, and particularly
in <i>Rome</i>, as Transalpine Diligence can imagine it to be: and
collecting together all the proper speculations that concerne the
<i>Copernican Systeme</i> to let them know, that the notice of all
preceded the Censure of the <i>Roman Court</i>; and that there
proceed from this Climate not only Doctrines for the health of
the Soul, but also ingenious Discoveries for the recreating of
the Mind.... I hope that by these considerations the world
will know, that if other Nations have Navigated more than we,
we have not studied less than they; and that our returning to
assert the Earth’s stability, and to take the contrary only for
a Mathematical <i>Capriccio</i>, proceeds not from inadvertency of
what others have thought thereof, but (had one no other
inducements), from these reasons that Piety, Religion, the
Knowledge of the Divine Omnipotency, and a consciousness
of the incapacity of man’s understanding dictate unto us.”<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_132"></a>132. Naturally Galilei’s many enemies were not long in
penetrating these thin disguises, and the immense success
of the book only intensified the opposition which it excited;
the Pope appears to have been persuaded that Simplicio—the
butt of the whole dialogue—was intended for himself,
a supposed insult which bitterly wounded his vanity; and
it was soon evident that the publication of the book could
not be allowed to pass without notice. In June 1632 a
special commission was appointed to inquire into the
matter—an unusual procedure, probably meant as a mark
of consideration for Galilei—and two months later the
further issue of copies of the book was prohibited, and in
September a papal mandate was issued requiring Galilei
to appear personally before the Inquisition. He was evidently
frightened by the summons, and tried to avoid compliance
through the good offices of the Tuscan court and
by pleading his age and infirmities, but after considerable
delay, at the end of which the Pope issued instructions to
bring him if necessary by force and in chains, he had
to submit, and set off for Rome early in 1633. Here he
was treated with unusual consideration, for whereas in
general even the most eminent offenders under trial by the
Inquisition were confined in its prisons, he was allowed to
live with his friend Niccolini, the Tuscan ambassador,
throughout the trial, with the exception of a period of
about three weeks, which he spent within the buildings
of the Inquisition, in comfortable rooms belonging to one of
the officials, with permission to correspond with his friends,
to take exercise in the garden, and other privileges. At
his first hearing before the Inquisition, his reply to the
charge of having violated the decree of 1616 (<a href="#para_126">§&nbsp;126</a>) was
that he had not understood that the decree or the admonition
given to him forbade the teaching of the Coppernican
theory as a mere “hypothesis,” and that his book had not
upheld the doctrine in any other way. Between his first
and second hearing the Commission, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
examining his book, reported that it did distinctly defend
and maintain the obnoxious doctrines, and Galilei, having
been meanwhile privately advised by the Commissary-General
of the Inquisition to adopt a more submissive
attitude, admitted at the next hearing that on reading his
book again he recognised that parts of it gave the arguments
for Coppernicanism more strongly than he had at first
thought. The pitiable state to which he had been reduced
was shewn by the offer which he now made to write a
continuation to the Dialogue which should as far as possible
refute his own Coppernican arguments. At the final
hearing on June 21st he was examined under threat of
torture,<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and on the next day he was brought up for
sentence. He was convicted “of believing and holding
the doctrines—false and contrary to the Holy and Divine
Scriptures—that the sun is the centre of the world, and
that it does not move from east to west, and that the earth
does move and is not the centre of the world; also that an
opinion can be held and supported as probable after it has
been declared and decreed contrary to the Holy Scriptures.”
In punishment, he was required to “abjure, curse, and
detest the aforesaid errors,” the abjuration being at once
read by him on his knees; and was further condemned to
the “formal prison of the Holy Office” during the pleasure
of his judges, and required to repeat the seven penitential
psalms once a week for three years. On the following day
the Pope changed the sentence of imprisonment into confinement
at a country-house near Rome belonging to the
Grand Duke, and Galilei moved there on June 24th.<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> On
petitioning to be allowed to return to Florence, he was at
first allowed to go as far as Siena, and at the end of the
year was permitted to retire to his country-house at Arcetri
near Florence, on condition of not leaving it for the future
without permission, while his intercourse with scientific and
other friends was jealously watched.</p>

<p>The story of the trial reflects little credit either on
Galilei or on his persecutors. For the latter, it may be
urged that they acted with unusual leniency considering
the customs of the time; and it is probable that many
of those who were concerned in the trial were anxious to
do as little injury to Galilei as possible, but were practically
forced by the party personally hostile to him to take some
notice of the obvious violation of the decree of 1616. It
is easy to condemn Galilei for cowardice, but it must be
borne in mind, on the one hand, that he was at the time
nearly seventy, and much shaken in health, and, on the
other, that the Roman Inquisition, if not as cruel as the
Spanish, was a very real power in the early 17th century;
during Galilei’s lifetime (1600) Giordano Bruno had been
burnt alive at Rome for writings which, in addition to
containing religious and political heresies, supported the
Coppernican astronomy and opposed the traditional
Aristotelian philosophy. Moreover, it would be unfair to
regard his submission as due merely to considerations of
personal safety, for—apart from the question whether his
beloved science would have gained anything by his death
or permanent imprisonment—there can be no doubt that
Galilei was a perfectly sincere member of his Church, and
although he did his best to convince individual officers
of the Church of the correctness of his views, and to
minimise the condemnation of them passed in 1616, yet
he was probably prepared, when he found that the condemnation
was seriously meant by the Pope, the Holy
Office, and others, to believe that in some senses at least
his views must be wrong, although, as a matter of observation
and pure reason, he was unable to see how or why.
In fact, like many other excellent people, he kept watertight
compartments in his mind, respect for the Church
being in one and scientific investigation in another.</p>

<p>Copies of the sentence on Galilei and of his abjuration
were at once circulated in Italy and in Roman Catholic
circles elsewhere, and a decree of the Congregation of the
Index was also issued adding the <i>Dialogue</i> to the three
Coppernican books condemned in 1616, and to Kepler’s
<i>Epitome</i> of the Coppernican Astronomy (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_145">§&nbsp;145</a>),
which had been put on the <i>Index</i> shortly afterwards. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
may be of interest to note that these five books still remained
in the edition of the <i>Index of Prohibited Books</i> which was
issued in 1819 (with appendices dated as late as 1821),
but disappeared from the next edition, that of 1835.</p>

<p><a id="para_133"></a>133. The rest of Galilei’s life may be described very
briefly. With the exception of a few months, during which
he was allowed to be at Florence for the sake of medical
treatment, he remained continuously at Arcetri, evidently
pretty closely watched by the agents of the Holy Office,
much restricted in his intercourse with his friends, and
prevented from carrying on his studies in the directions
which he liked best. He was moreover very infirm, and
he was afflicted by domestic troubles, especially by the
death in 1634 of his favourite child, a nun in a neighbouring
convent. But his spirit was not broken, and he went on
with several important pieces of work, which he had begun
earlier in his career. He carried a little further the study
of his beloved Medicean Planets and of the method of finding
longitude based on their movements (<a href="#para_127">§&nbsp;127</a>), and negotiated
on the subject with the Dutch government. He made also
a further discovery relating to the moon, of sufficient
importance to deserve a few words of explanation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_58"></a>
<img src="images/i_p173.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>—The daily libration of the moon.</div>
</div>

<p>It had long been well known that as the moon describes
her monthly path round the earth we see the same markings
substantially in the same positions on the disc, so that
substantially the same face of the moon is turned towards
the earth. It occurred to Galilei to inquire whether this
was accurately the case, or whether, on the contrary, some
change in the moon’s disc could be observed. He saw
that if, as seemed likely, the line joining the centres of the
earth and moon always passed through the same point
on the moon’s surface, nevertheless certain alterations in
an observer’s position on the earth would enable him to
see different portions of the moon’s surface from time to
time. The simplest of these alterations is due to the daily
motion of the earth. Let us suppose for simplicity that
the observer is on the earth’s equator, and that the moon is
at the time in the celestial equator. Let the larger circle
in fig. 58 represent the earth’s equator, and the smaller
circle the section of the moon by the plane of the equator.
Then in about 12 hours the earth’s rotation carries the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
observer from <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, where he sees the moon rising, to <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, where
he sees it setting. When he is at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, on the line joining the
centres of the earth and moon, the point <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> appears to be in
the centre of the moon’s disc, and the portion <i>c</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> <i>c′</i> is visible,
<i>c</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> <i>c′</i> invisible. But when the observer is at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, the point <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>,
on the right of <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, appears in the centre, and the portion
<i>a</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> <i>a′</i> is visible, so that <i>c′ a′</i> is now visible and <i>a c</i> invisible.
In the same way, when the observer is at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, he can see the
portion <i>c b</i>, while <i>b′ c′</i> is invisible and <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span> appears to be in
the centre of the disc. Thus in the course of the day
the portion <i>a</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> <i>b′</i> (dotted in the figure) is constantly visible
and <i>b</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span> <i>a′</i> (also dotted) constantly invisible, while <i>a c b</i>
and <i>a′ c′ b′</i> alternately come into view and disappear. In
other words, when the moon is rising we see a little
more of the side which is the then uppermost, and when
she is setting we see a little more of the other side which is
uppermost in this position. A similar explanation applies
when the observer is not on the earth’s equator, but the
geometry is slightly more complicated. In the same way, as
the moon passes from south to north of the equator and back
as she revolves round the earth, we see alternately more and
less of the northern and southern half of the moon. This
set of changes—the simplest of several somewhat similar
ones which are now known as <b>librations</b> of the moon—being
thus thought of as likely to occur, Galilei set to work to test
their existence by observing certain markings of the moon
usually visible near the edge, and at once detected alterations
in their distance from the edge, which were in general
accordance with his theoretical anticipations. A more
precise inquiry was however interrupted by failing sight,
culminating (at the end of 1636) in total blindness.</p>

<p>But the most important work of these years was the
completion of the great book, in which he summed up
and completed his discoveries in mechanics, <i>Mathematical
Discourses and Demonstrations concerning Two
New Sciences, relating to Mechanics and to Local Motion</i>.
It was written in the form of a dialogue between the same
three speakers who figured in the Dialogue on the Systems,
but is distinctly inferior in literary merit to the earlier
work. We have here no concern with a large part of
the book, which deals with the conditions under which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
bodies are kept, at rest by forces applied to them (statics),
and certain problems relating to the resistance of bodies
to fracture and to bending, though in both of these
subjects Galilei broke new ground. More important
astronomically—and probably intrinsically also—is what he
calls the science of local motion,<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> which deals with the
motion of bodies. He builds up on the basis of his early
experiments (<a href="#para_116">§&nbsp;116</a>) a theory of falling bodies, in which
occurs for the first time the important idea of <b>uniformly
accelerated motion</b>, or <b>uniform acceleration</b>, <i>i.e.</i> motion
in which the moving body receives in every equal interval
of time an equal increase of velocity. He shews that the
motion of a falling body is—except in so far as it is disturbed
by the air—of this nature, and that, as already
stated, the motion is the same for all bodies, although
his numerical estimate is not at all accurate.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> From this
fundamental law he works out a number of mathematical
deductions, connecting the space fallen through, the velocity,
and the time elapsed, both for the case of a body falling
freely and for one falling down an inclined plane. He
gives also a correct elementary theory of projectiles, in
the course of which he enunciates more completely than
before the law of inertia already referred to (<a href="#para_130">§&nbsp;130</a>),
although Galilei’s form is still much less general than
Newton’s:—</p>

<p><i>Conceive a body projected or thrown along a horizontal
plane, all impediments being removed. Now it is clear by
what we have said before at length that its motion will
be uniform and perpetual along the said plane, if the plane
extend indefinitely.</i></p>

<p>In connection with projectiles, Galilei also appears to
realise that a body may be conceived as having motions
in two different directions simultaneously, and that each
may be treated as independent of the other, so that,
for example, if a bullet is shot horizontally out of a
gun, its downward motion, due to its weight, is unaffected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
by its horizontal motion, and consequently it reaches
the ground at the same time as a bullet simply allowed
to drop; but Galilei gives no general statement of this
principle, which was afterwards embodied by Newton in
his Second Law of Motion.</p>

<p>The treatise on the <i>Two New Sciences</i> was finished in
1636, and, since no book of Galilei’s could be printed in
Italy, it was published after some little delay at Leyden
in 1638. In the same year his eyesight, which he had
to some extent recovered after his first attack of blindness,
failed completely, and four years later (January 8th, 1642)
the end came.</p>

<p><a id="para_134"></a>134. Galilei’s chief scientific discoveries have already
been noticed. The telescopic discoveries, on which much
of his popular reputation rests, have probably attracted
more than their fair share of attention; many of them
were made almost simultaneously by others, and the rest,
being almost inevitable results of the invention of the
telescope, could not have been delayed long. But the
skilful use which Galilei made of them as arguments for
the Coppernican system, the no less important support
which his dynamical discoveries gave to the same cause,
the lucidity and dialectic brilliance with which he marshalled
the arguments in favour of his views and demolished
those of his opponents, together with the sensational incidents
of his persecution, formed conjointly a contribution
to the Coppernican controversy which was in effect
decisive. Astronomical textbooks still continued to give
side by side accounts of the Ptolemaic and of the Coppernican
systems, and the authors, at any rate if they were
good Roman Catholics, usually expressed, in some more
or less perfunctory way, their adherence to the former, but
there was no real life left in the traditional astronomy;
new advances in astronomical theory were all on Coppernican
lines, and in the extensive scientific correspondence
of Newton and his contemporaries the truth of the
Coppernican system scarcely ever appears as a subject for
discussion.</p>

<p>Galilei’s dynamical discoveries, which are only in part
of astronomical importance, are in many respects his
most remarkable contribution to science. For whereas in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
astronomy he was building on foundations laid by previous
generations, in dynamics it was no question of improving
or developing an existing science, but of creating
a new one. From his predecessors he inherited nothing
but erroneous traditions and obscure ideas; and when these
had been discarded, he had to arrive at clear fundamental
notions, to devise experiments and make observations, to
interpret his experimental results, and to follow out the
mathematical consequences of the simple laws first arrived
at. The positive results obtained may not appear numerous,
if viewed from the standpoint of our modern knowledge,
but they sufficed to constitute a secure basis for the superstructure
which later investigators added.</p>

<p>It is customary to associate with our countryman Francis
Bacon (1561-1627) the reform in methods of scientific
discovery which took place during the seventeenth century,
and to which much of the rapid progress in the natural
sciences made since that time must be attributed. The
value of Bacon’s theory of scientific discovery is very
differently estimated by different critics, but there can be
no question of the singular ill-success which attended his
attempts to apply it in particular cases, and it may fairly
be questioned whether the scientific methods constantly
referred to incidentally by Galilei, and brilliantly exemplified
by his practice, do not really contain a large part of what
is valuable in the Baconian philosophy of science, while at
the same time avoiding some of its errors. Reference has
already been made on several occasions to Galilei’s protests
against the current method of dealing with scientific
questions by the interpretation of passages in Aristotle,
Ptolemy, or other writers; and to his constant insistence
on the necessity of appealing directly to actual observation
of facts. But while thus agreeing with Bacon in these
essential points, he differed from him in the recognition
of the importance, both of deducing new results from
established ones by mathematical or other processes of
exact reasoning, and of using such deductions, when
compared with fresh experimental results, as a means of
verifying hypotheses provisionally adopted. This method
of proof, which lies at the base of nearly all important
scientific discovery, can hardly be described better than by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Galilei’s own statement of it, as applied to a particular
case:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Let us therefore take this at present as a <i>Postulatum</i>, the
truth whereof we shall afterwards find established, when we
shall see other conclusions built upon this <i>Hypothesis</i>, to answer
and most exactly to agree with Experience.”<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p></blockquote>

<small>KEPLER.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“His celebrated laws were the outcome of a lifetime of speculation,
for the most part vain and groundless.... But Kepler’s name was
destined to be immortal, on account of the patience with which he
submitted his hypotheses to comparison with observation, the candour
with which he acknowledged failure after failure, and the perseverance
and ingenuity with which he renewed his attack upon the
riddles of nature.”</p>

<p><a id="para_135"></a>135. John Kepler, or Keppler,<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> was born in 1571, seven
years after Galilei, at Weil in Würtemberg; his parents were
in reduced circumstances, though his father had some claims
to noble descent. Though Weil itself was predominantly
Roman Catholic, the Keplers were Protestants, a fact which
frequently stood in Kepler’s way at various stages of his
career. But the father could have been by no means
zealous in his faith, for he enlisted in the army of the
notorious Duke of Alva when it was engaged in trying to
suppress the revolt of the Netherlands against Spanish
persecution.</p>

<p>John Kepler’s childhood was marked by more than the
usual number of illnesses, and his bodily weaknesses,
combined with a promise of great intellectual ability, seemed
to point to the Church as a suitable career for him. After
attending various elementary schools with great irregularity—due
partly to ill-health, partly to the requirements of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
manual work at home—he was sent in 1584 at the public
expense to the monastic school at Adelberg, and two years
later to the more advanced school or college of the
same kind at Maulbronn, which was connected with the
University of Tübingen, then one of the great centres of
Protestant theology.</p>

<p>In 1588 he obtained the B.A. degree, and in the following
year entered the philosophical faculty at Tübingen.</p>

<p>There he came under the influence of Maestlin, the
professor of mathematics, by whom he was in private
taught the principles of the Coppernican system, though
the professorial lectures were still on the traditional lines.</p>

<p>In 1591 Kepler graduated as M.A., being second out of
fourteen candidates, and then devoted himself chiefly to
the study of theology.</p>

<p><a id="para_136"></a>136. In 1594, however, the Protestant Estates of Styria
applied to Tübingen for a lecturer on mathematics (including
astronomy) for the high school of Gratz, and the
appointment was offered to Kepler. Having no special
knowledge of the subject and as yet no taste for it, he
naturally hesitated about accepting the offer, but finally
decided to do so, expressly stipulating, however, that he
should not thereby forfeit his claims to ecclesiastical
preferment in Würtemberg. The demand for higher
mathematics at Gratz seems to have been slight; during
his first year Kepler’s mathematical lectures were attended
by very few students, and in the following year by none,
so that to prevent his salary from being wasted he was
set to teach the elements of various other subjects. It
was moreover one of his duties to prepare an annual
almanack or calendar, which was expected to contain not
merely the usual elementary astronomical information such
as we are accustomed to in the calendars of to-day, but
also astrological information of a more interesting character,
such as predictions of the weather and of remarkable events,
guidance as to unlucky and lucky times, and the like.
Kepler’s first calendar, for the year 1595, contained some
happy weather-prophecies, and he acquired accordingly a
considerable popular reputation as a prophet and astrologer,
which remained throughout his life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his official duties evidently left him a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
deal of leisure, which he spent with characteristic energy
in acquiring as thorough a knowledge as possible of
astronomy, and in speculating on the subject.</p>

<p>According to his own statement, “there were three
things in particular, <i>viz.</i> the number, the size, and the
motion of the heavenly bodies, as to which he searched
zealously for reasons why they were as they were and not
otherwise”; and the results of a long course of wild
speculation on the subject led him at last to a result with
which he was immensely pleased—a numerical relation
connecting the distances of the several planets from the
sun with certain geometrical bodies known as the regular
solids (of which the cube is the best known), a relation
which is not very accurate numerically, and is of absolutely
no significance or importance.<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> This discovery, together
with a detailed account of the steps which led to it, as well
as of a number of other steps which led nowhere, was
published in 1596 in a book a portion of the title of which
may be translated as <i>The Forerunner of Dissertations on
the Universe, containing the Mystery of the Universe</i>,
commonly referred to as the <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>.
The contents were probably much more attractive and
seemed more valuable to Kepler’s contemporaries than
to us, but even to those who were least inclined to attach
weight to its conclusions, the book shewed evidence
of considerable astronomical knowledge and very great
ingenuity; and both Tycho Brahe and Galilei, to whom
copies were sent, recognised in the author a rising
astronomer likely to do good work.</p>

<p><a id="para_137"></a>137. In 1597 Kepler married. In the following year the
religious troubles, which had for some years been steadily
growing, were increased by the action of the Archduke
Ferdinand of Austria (afterwards the Emperor Ferdinand II.),
who on his return from a pilgrimage to Loretto started a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
vigorous persecution of Protestants in his dominions, one
step in which was an order that all Protestant ministers
and teachers in Styria should quit the country at once
(1598). Kepler accordingly fled to Hungary, but returned
after a few weeks by special permission of the Archduke,
given apparently on the advice of the Jesuit party, who had
hopes of converting the astronomer. Kepler’s hearers had,
however, mostly been scattered by the persecution, it became
difficult to ensure regular payment of his stipend,
and the rising tide of Catholicism made his position increasingly
insecure. Tycho’s overtures were accordingly
welcome, and in 1600 he paid a visit to him, as already
described (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_108">§&nbsp;108</a>), at Benatek and Prague. He
returned to Gratz in the autumn, still uncertain whether to
accept Tycho’s offer or not, but being then definitely
dismissed from his position at Gratz on account of his
Protestant opinions, he returned finally to Prague at the
end of the year.</p>

<p><a id="para_138"></a>138. Soon after Tycho’s death Kepler was appointed his
successor as mathematician to the Emperor Rudolph (1602),
but at only half his predecessor’s salary, and even this was
paid with great irregularity, so that complaints as to arrears
and constant pecuniary difficulties played an important part
in his future life, as they had done during the later years
at Gratz. Tycho’s instruments never passed into his possession,
but as he had little taste or skill for observing, the
loss was probably not great; fortunately, after some difficulties
with the heirs, he secured control of the greater part
of Tycho’s incomparable series of observations, the working
up of which into an improved theory of the solar system
was the main occupation of the next 25 years of his life.
Before, however, he had achieved any substantial result in
this direction, he published several minor works—for example,
two pamphlets on a new star which appeared in 1604,
and a treatise on the applications of optics to astronomy
(published in 1604 with a title beginning <i>Ad Vitellionem
Paralipomena quibus Astronomiae Pars Optica Traditur</i> ...),
the most interesting and important part of which was a
considerable improvement in the theory of astronomical
refraction (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_46">§&nbsp;46</a>, and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_110">§&nbsp;110</a>). A
later optical treatise (the <i>Dioptrice</i> of 1611) contained a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
suggestion for the construction of a telescope by the use
of two convex lenses, which is the form now most commonly
adopted, and is a notable improvement on Galilei’s instrument
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_118">§&nbsp;118</a>), one of the lenses of which is
concave; but Kepler does not seem himself to have had
enough mechanical skill to actually construct a telescope
on this plan, or to have had access to workmen capable
of doing so for him; and it is probable that Galilei’s
enemy Scheiner (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_124">§§&nbsp;124</a>, 125) was the first
person to use (about 1613) an instrument of this kind.</p>

<a id="KEPLER"></a>

<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 183.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_139"></a>139. It has already been mentioned (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_108">§&nbsp;108</a>)
that when Tycho was dividing the work of his observatory
among his assistants he assigned to Kepler the study of
the planet Mars, probably as presenting more difficulties
than the subjects assigned to the others. It had been
known since the time of Coppernicus that the planets,
including the earth, revolved round the sun in paths that
were at any rate not very different from circles, and
that the deviations from uniform circular motion could be
represented roughly by systems of eccentrics and epicycles.
The deviations from uniform circular motion were, however,
notably different in amount in different planets, being,
for example, very small in the case of Venus, relatively large
in the case of Mars, and larger still in that of Mercury.
The <i>Prussian Tables</i> calculated by Reinhold on a Coppernican
basis (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_94">§&nbsp;94</a>) were soon found to represent
the actual motions very imperfectly, errors of 4° and 5°
having been noted by Tycho and Kepler, so that the
principles on which the tables were calculated were evidently
at fault.</p>

<p>The solution of the problem was clearly more likely
to be found by the study of a planet in which the deviations
from circular motion were as great as possible.
In the case of Mercury satisfactory observations were
scarce, whereas in the case of Mars there was an abundant
series recorded by Tycho, and hence it was true insight on
Tycho’s part to assign to his ablest assistant this particular
planet, and on Kepler’s to continue the research with unwearied
patience. The particular system of epicycles used
by Coppernicus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_87">§&nbsp;87</a>) having proved defective,
Kepler set to work to devise other geometrical schemes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
results of which could be compared with observation. The
places of Mars as seen on the sky being a combined result
of the motions of Mars and of the earth in their respective
orbits round the sun, the irregularities of the two orbits
were apparently inextricably mixed up, and a great simplification
was accordingly effected when Kepler succeeded,
by an ingenious combination of observations taken at suitable
times, in disentangling the irregularities due to the
earth from those due to the motion of Mars itself, and
thus rendering it possible to concentrate his attention on
the latter. His fertile imagination suggested hypothesis
after hypothesis, combination after combination of eccentric,
epicycle, and equant; he calculated the results of each and
compared them rigorously with observation; and at one
stage he arrived at a geometrical scheme which was capable
of representing the observations with errors not exceeding
8′.<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> A man of less intellectual honesty, or less convinced
of the necessity of subordinating theory to fact when the
two conflict, might have rested content with this degree
of accuracy, or might have supposed Tycho’s refractory
observations to be in error. Kepler, however, thought
otherwise:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Since the divine goodness has given to us in Tycho Brahe a
most careful observer, from whose observations the error of 8′
is shewn in this calculation, ... it is right that we should with
gratitude recognise and make use of this gift of God.... For if
I could have treated 8′ of longitude as negligible I should have
already corrected sufficiently the hypothesis ... discovered in
chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XVI</span>. But as they could not be neglected, these 8′
alone have led the way towards the complete reformation of
astronomy, and have been made the subject-matter of a great
part of this work.”<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_140"></a>140. He accordingly started afresh, and after trying a variety
of other combinations of circles decided that the path of
Mars must be an oval of some kind. At first he was inclined
to believe in an egg-shaped oval, larger at one end than
at the other, but soon had to abandon this idea. Finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
he tried the simplest known oval curve, the <b>ellipse</b>,<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and
found to his delight that it satisfied the conditions of the
problem, if the sun were taken to be at a focus of the ellipse
described by Mars.</p>

<p>It was further necessary to formulate the law of variation
of the rate of motion of the planet in different parts of its
orbit. Here again Kepler tried a number of hypotheses, in
the course of which he fairly lost his way in the intricacies
of the mathematical questions involved, but fortunately
arrived, after a dubious process of compensation of errors,
at a simple law which agreed with observation. He found
that the planet moved fast when near the sun and slowly
when distant from it, in such a way that the area described
or swept out in any time by the line joining the sun to
Mars was always proportional to the time. Thus in fig. 60<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
the motion of Mars is most rapid at the point <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> nearest to
the focus <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> where the sun is, least rapid at <span class="smcap lowercase">A′</span>, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
shaded and unshaded portions of the figure represent equal
areas each corresponding to the motion of the planet during
a month. Kepler’s triumph at arriving at this result is
expressed by the figure of victory in the corner of the
diagram (fig. 61) which was used in establishing the last
stage of his proof.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>—Kepler’s second law.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_141"></a>141. Thus were established for the case of Mars the two important
results generally known as Kepler’s first two laws:—</p>

<p>1. <i>The planet describes an ellipse, the sun being in one focus.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>The straight line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out
equal areas in any two equal intervals of time.</i></p>

<p>The full history of this investigation, with the results
already stated and a number of developments and results
of minor importance, together with innumerable digressions
and quaint comments on the progress of the inquiry, was
published in 1609 in a book of considerable length, the
<i>Commentaries on the Motions of Mars</i>.<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

</div>

<p><a id="para_142"></a>142. Although the two laws of planetary motion just
given were only fully established for the case of Mars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Kepler stated that the earth’s path also must be an oval
of some kind, and was evidently already convinced—aided
by his firm belief in the harmony of Nature—that all the
planets moved in accordance with the same laws. This view
is indicated in the dedication of the book to the Emperor
Rudolph, which gives a fanciful account of the work as a
struggle against the rebellious War-God Mars, as the result
of which he is finally brought captive to the feet of the
Emperor and undertakes to live for the future as a loyal
subject. As, however, he has many relations in the
ethereal spaces—his father Jupiter, his grandfather Saturn,
his dear sister Venus, his faithful brother Mercury—and he
yearns for them and they for him <i>on account of the similarity
of their habits</i>, he entreats the Emperor to send out an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
expedition as soon as possible to capture them also, and
with that object to provide Kepler with the “sinews of
war” in order that he may equip a suitable army.</p>

<p>Although the money thus delicately asked for was only
supplied very irregularly, Kepler kept steadily in view the
expedition for which it was to be used, or, in plainer words,
he worked steadily at the problem of extending his elliptic
theory to the other planets, and constructing the tables of
the planetary motions, based on Tycho’s observations, at
which he had so long been engaged.</p>

<p><a id="para_143"></a>143. In 1611 his patron Rudolph was forced to abdicate
the imperial crown in favour of his brother Matthias, who
had little interest in astronomy, or even in astrology; and
as Kepler’s position was thus rendered more insecure than
ever, he opened negotiations with the Estates of Upper
Austria, as the result of which he was promised a small
salary, on condition of undertaking the somewhat varied
duties of teaching mathematics at the high school of Linz,
the capital, of constructing a new map of the province, and
of completing his planetary tables. For the present, however,
he decided to stay with Rudolph.</p>

<p>In the same year Kepler lost his wife, who had long
been in weak bodily and mental health.</p>

<p>In the following year (1612) Rudolph died, and Kepler
then moved to Linz and took up his new duties there,
though still holding the appointment of mathematician to
the Emperor and occasionally even receiving some portion
of the salary of the office. In 1613 he married again, after
a careful consideration, recorded in an extraordinary but
very characteristic letter to one of his friends, of the relative
merits of eleven ladies whom he regarded as possible; and
the provision of a proper supply of wine for his new household
led to the publication of a pamphlet, of some mathematical
interest, dealing with the proper way of measuring
the contents of a cask with curved sides.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p><a id="para_144"></a>144. In the years 1618-1621, although in some ways the
most disturbed years of his life, he published three books
of importance—an <i>Epitome of the Copernican Astronomy</i>,
the <i>Harmony of the World</i>,<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> and a treatise on <i>Comets</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>The second and most important of these, published in
1619, though the leading idea in it was discovered early
in 1618, was regarded by Kepler as a development of his
early <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i> (<a href="#para_136">§&nbsp;136</a>). His speculative
and mystic temperament led him constantly to search
for relations between the various numerical quantities occurring
in the solar system; by a happy inspiration he thought
of trying to get a relation connecting the sizes of the orbits
of the various planets with their times of revolution round
the sun, and after a number of unsuccessful attempts discovered
a simple and important relation, commonly known
as Kepler’s third law:—</p>

<p><i>The squares of the times of revolution of any two planets
(including the earth) about the sun are proportional to the
cubes of their mean distances from the sun.</i></p>

<p>If, for example, we express the times of revolution of
the various planets in terms of any one, which may be conveniently
taken to be that of the earth, namely a year, and in
the same way express the distances in terms of the distance
of the earth from the sun as a unit, then the times of
revolution of the several planets taken in the order Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn are approximately ·24,
·615, 1, 1·88, 11·86, 29·457, and their distances from the
sun are respectively ·387, ·723, 1, 1·524, 5·203, 9·539; if
now we take the squares of the first series of numbers (the
square of a number being the number multiplied by itself)
and the cubes of the second series (the cube of a number
being the number multiplied by itself twice, or the square
multiplied again by the number), we get the two series of
numbers given approximately by the table:—</p>

<div class="center small">

<p>Here it will be seen that the two series of numbers, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
upper and lower row respectively, agree completely for as
many decimal places as are given, except in the cases of
the two outer planets, where the lower numbers are slightly
in excess of the upper. For this discrepancy Newton afterwards
assigned a reason (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_186">§&nbsp;186</a>), but with the
somewhat imperfect knowledge of the times of revolution
and distances which Kepler possessed the discrepancy
was barely capable of detection, and he was therefore
justified—from his standpoint—in speaking of the law as
“precise.”<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>—The “music of the spheres,” according to Kepler.
From the <i>Harmony of the World</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>It should be noticed further that Kepler’s law requires
no knowledge of the actual distances of the several planets
from the sun, but only of their relative distances, <i>i.e.</i> the
number of times farther off from the sun or nearer to the
sun any planet is than any other. In other words, it is
necessary to have or to be able to construct a map of the
solar system correct in its <i>proportions</i>, but it is quite
unnecessary for this purpose to know the <i>scale</i> of the map.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Harmony of the World</i> is a large book,
there is scarcely anything of value in it except what has
already been given. A good deal of space is occupied
with repetitions of the earlier speculations contained in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
<i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>, and most of the rest is filled
with worthless analogies between the proportions of the
solar system and the relations between various musical
scales.</p>

<p>He is bold enough to write down in black and white the
“music of the spheres” (in the form shewn in fig. 62), while
the nonsense which he was capable of writing may be
further illustrated by the remark which occurs in the same
part of the book: “The Earth sings the notes M I, F A, M I,
so that you may guess from them that in this abode of ours
MIsery (<i>miseria</i>) and FAmine (<i>fames</i>) prevail.”</p>

<p><a id="para_145"></a>145. The <i>Epitome of the Copernican Astronomy</i>, which
appeared in parts in 1618, 1620, and 1621, although there
are no very striking discoveries in it, is one of the most
attractive of Kepler’s books, being singularly free from the
extravagances which usually render his writings so tedious.
It contains within moderately short compass, in the form
of question and answer, an account of astronomy as known
at the time, expounded from the Coppernican standpoint,
and embodies both Kepler’s own and Galilei’s latest discoveries.
Such a textbook supplied a decided want, and
that this was recognised by enemies as well as by friends
was shewn by its prompt appearance in the Roman <i>Index
of Prohibited Books</i> (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_126">§§&nbsp;126</a>, 132). The
<i>Epitome</i> contains the first clear statement that the two
fundamental laws of planetary motion established for the
case of Mars (<a href="#para_141">§&nbsp;141</a>) were true also for the other planets
(no satisfactory proof being, however, given), and that they
applied also to the motion of the moon round the earth,
though in this case there were further irregularities which
complicated matters. The theory of the moon is worked
out in considerable detail, both evection (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_48">§&nbsp;48</a>)
and variation (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, §&nbsp;60; chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_111">§&nbsp;111</a>) being
fully dealt with, though the “annual equation” which
Tycho had just begun to recognise at the end of his life
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_111">§&nbsp;111</a>) is not discussed. Another interesting
development of his own discoveries is the recognition
that his third law of planetary motion applied also to
the movements of the four satellites round Jupiter, as
recorded by Galilei and Simon Marius (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_118">§&nbsp;118</a>).
Kepler also introduced in the <i>Epitome</i> a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
improvement in the customary estimate of the distance of
the earth from the sun, from which those of the other
planets could at once be deduced.</p>

<p>If, as had been generally believed since the time of
Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the distance of the sun were
1,200 times the radius of the earth, then the parallax
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§§&nbsp;43</a>, 49) of the sun would at times be as
much as 3′, and that of Mars, which in some positions is
much nearer to the earth, proportionally larger. But Kepler
had been unable to detect any parallax of Mars, and therefore
inferred that the distances of Mars and of the sun
must be greater than had been supposed. Having no
exact data to go on, he produced out of his imagination
and his ideas of the harmony of the solar system a distance
about three times as great as the traditional one. He
argued that, as the earth was the abode of measuring
creatures, it was reasonable to expect that the measurements
of the solar system would bear some simple relation to the
dimensions of the earth. Accordingly he assumed that
the volume of the sun was as many times greater than the
volume of the earth as the distance of the sun was greater
than the radius of the earth, and from this quaint assumption
deduced the value of the distance already stated, which,
though an improvement on the old value, was still only
about one-seventh of the true distance.</p>

<p>The <i>Epitome</i> contains also a good account of eclipses
both of the sun and moon, with the causes, means of
predicting them, etc. The faint light (usually reddish) with
which the face of the eclipsed moon often shines is correctly
explained as being sunlight which has passed through
the atmosphere of the earth, and has there been bent from
a straight course so as to reach the moon, which the light
of the sun in general is, owing to the interposition of the
earth, unable to reach. Kepler mentions also a ring of
light seen round the eclipsed sun in 1567, when the
eclipse was probably total, not annular (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§&nbsp;43</a>),
and ascribes it to some sort of luminous atmosphere round
the sun, referring to a description in Plutarch of the same
appearance. This seems to have been an early observation,
and a rational though of course very imperfect explanation,
of that remarkable solar envelope known as the <b>corona</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
which has attracted so much attention in the last half-century
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_301">§&nbsp;301</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_146"></a>146. The treatise on <i>Comets</i> (1619) contained an account
of a comet seen in 1607, afterwards famous as Halley’s
comet (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_200">§&nbsp;200</a>), and of three comets seen in 1618.
Following Tycho, Kepler held firmly the view that comets
were celestial not terrestrial bodies, and accounted for their
appearance and disappearance by supposing that they moved
in straight lines, and therefore after having once passed
near the earth receded indefinitely into space; he does
not appear to have made any serious attempt to test this
theory by comparison with observation, being evidently
of opinion that the path of a body which would never
reappear was not a suitable object for serious study. He
agreed with the observation made by Fracastor and Apian
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_69">§&nbsp;69</a>) that comets’ tails point away from the
sun, and explained this by the supposition that the tail is
formed by rays of the sun which penetrate the body of
the comet and carry away with them some portion of its
substance, a theory which, allowance being made for the
change in our view’s as to the nature of light, is a curiously
correct anticipation of modern theories of comets’ tails
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_304">§&nbsp;304</a>).</p>

<p>In a book intended to have a popular sale it was
necessary to make the most of the “meaning” of the
appearance of a comet, and of its influence on human
affairs, and as Kepler was writing when the Thirty Years’
War had just begun, while religious persecutions and wars
had been going on in Europe almost without interruption
during his lifetime, it was not difficult to find sensational
events which had happened soon after or shortly before
the appearance of the comets referred to. Kepler himself
was evidently not inclined to attach much importance to
such coincidences; he thought that possibly actual contact
with a comet’s tail might produce pestilence, but beyond
that was not prepared to do more than endorse the pious if
somewhat neutral opinion that one of the uses of a comet is
to remind us that we are mortal. His belief that comets are
very numerous is expressed in the curious form:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> “There
are as many arguments to prove the annual motion of the
earth round the sun as there are comets in the heavens.”</p>

<p><a id="para_147"></a>147. Meanwhile Kepler’s position at Linz had become
more and more uncomfortable, owing to the rising tide
of the religious and political disturbances which finally
led to the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War in 1618; but
notwithstanding this he had refused in 1617 an offer of
a chair of mathematics at Bologna, partly through attachment
to his native country and partly through a well-founded
distrust of the Papal party in Italy. Three years afterwards
he rejected also the overtures made by the English
ambassador, with a view to securing him as an ornament
to the court of James I., one of his chief grounds for refusal
in this case being a doubt whether he would not suffer
from being cooped up within the limits of an island.
In 1619 the Emperor Matthias died, and was succeeded
by Ferdinand II., who as Archduke had started the persecution
of the Protestants at Gratz (<a href="#para_137">§&nbsp;137</a>) and who had
few scientific interests. Kepler was, however, after some
delay, confirmed in his appointment as Imperial Mathematician.
In 1620 Linz was occupied by the Imperialist
troops, and by 1626 the oppression of the Protestants by
the Roman Catholics had gone so far that Kepler made
up his mind to leave, and, after sending his family to
Regensburg, went himself to Ulm.</p>

<p><a id="para_148"></a>148. At Ulm Kepler published his last great work.
For more than a quarter of a century he had been
steadily working out in detail, on the basis of Tycho’s
observations and of his own theories, the motions of the
heavenly bodies, expressing the results in such convenient
tabular form that the determination of the place of any
body at any required time, as well as the investigation
of other astronomical events such as eclipses, became
merely a matter of calculation according to fixed rules;
this great undertaking, in some sense the summing up of
his own and of Tycho’s work, was finally published in 1627
as the <i>Rudolphine Tables</i> (the name being given in honour
of his former patron), and remained for something like
a century the standard astronomical tables.</p>

<p>It had long been Kepler’s intention, after finishing the
tables, to write a complete treatise on astronomy, to be
called the <i>New Almagest</i>; but this scheme was never fairly
started, much less carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p><a id="para_149"></a>149. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to secure
the arrears of his salary, he was told to apply to Wallenstein,
the famous Imperialist general, then established in Silesia
in a semi-independent position, who was keenly interested
in astrology and usually took about with him one or more
representatives of the art. Kepler accordingly joined
Wallenstein in 1628, and did astrology for him, in addition
to writing some minor astronomical and astrological treatises.
In 1630 he travelled to Regensburg, where the Diet was
then sitting, to press in person his claims for various arrears
of salary; but, worn out by anxiety and by the fatigues of
the journey, he was seized by a fever a few days after his
arrival, and died on November 15th (<span class="smcap lowercase">N.S.</span>), 1630, in his 59th
year.</p>

<p>The inventory of his property, made after his death,
shews that he was in possession of a substantial amount,
so that the effect of extreme poverty which his letters
convey must have been to a considerable extent due to his
over-anxious and excitable temperament.</p>

<p><a id="para_150"></a>150. In addition to the great discoveries already mentioned
Kepler made a good many minor contributions to
astronomy, such as new methods of finding the longitude,
and various improvements in methods of calculation required
for astronomical problems. He also made speculations of
some interest as to possible causes underlying the known
celestial motions. Whereas the Ptolemaic system required
a number of motions round mere geometrical points, centres
of epicycles or eccentrics, equants, etc., unoccupied by any
real body, and many such motions were still required by
Coppernicus, Kepler’s scheme of the solar system placed a
real body, the sun, at the most important point connected
with the path of each planet, and dealt similarly with the
moon’s motion round the earth and with that of the four
satellites round Jupiter. Motions of revolution came in
fact to be associated not with some central <i>point</i> but with
some central <i>body</i>, and it became therefore an inquiry of
interest to ascertain if there were any connection between
the motion and the central body. The property possessed
by a magnet of attracting a piece of iron at some little
distance from it suggested a possible analogy to Kepler,
who had read with care and was evidently impressed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the treatise <i>On the Magnet</i> (De Magnete) published in
1600 by our countryman <i>William Gilbert</i> of Colchester
(1540-1603). He suggested that the planets might thus
be regarded as connected with the sun, and therefore as
sharing to some extent the sun’s own motion of revolution.
In other words, a certain “carrying virtue” spread out
from the sun, with or like the rays of light and heat, and
tried to carry the planets round with the sun.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is therefore
a conflict between
the carrying
power of the sun and
the impotence or
material sluggishness
(<i>inertia</i>) of the
planet; each enjoys
some measure of
victory, for the former
moves the planet
from its position and
the latter frees the
planet’s body to some
extent from the bonds
in which it is thus
held, ... but only to
be captured again by
another portion of
this rotatory virtue.”<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The annexed
diagram is given
by Kepler in illustration of this rather confused and vague
theory.</p>

<img src="images/i_p196.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>—Kepler’s idea of gravity.
From the <i>Epitome</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>He believed also in a more general “gravity,” which he
defined<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> as “a mutual bodily affection between allied bodies
tending towards their union or junction,” and regarded the
tides as due to an action of this sort between the moon and
the water of the earth. But the speculative ideas thus
thrown out, which it is possible to regard as anticipations
of Newton’s discovery of universal gravitation, were not in
any way developed logically, and Kepler’s mechanical ideas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
were too imperfect for him to have made real progress in
this direction.</p>

<p><a id="para_151"></a>151. There are few astronomers about whose merits such
different opinions have been held as about Kepler. There
is, it is true, a general agreement as to the great importance
of his three laws of planetary motion, and as to the
substantial value of the <i>Rudolphine Tables</i> and of various
minor discoveries. These results, however, fill but a small
part of Kepler’s voluminous writings, which are encumbered
with masses of wild speculation, of mystic and occult
fancies, of astrology, weather prophecies, and the like, which
are not only worthless from the standpoint of modern
astronomy, but which—unlike many erroneous or imperfect
speculations—in no way pointed towards the direction in
which the science was next to make progress, and must
have appeared almost as unsound to sober-minded contemporaries
like Galilei as to us. Hence as one reads
chapter after chapter without a lucid still less a correct idea,
it is impossible to refrain from regrets that the intelligence
of Kepler should have been so wasted, and it is difficult
not to suspect at times that some of the valuable results
which lie imbedded in this great mass of tedious speculation
were arrived at by a mere accident. On the other
hand, it must not be forgotten that such accidents have a
habit of happening only to great men, and that if Kepler
loved to give reins to his imagination he was equally impressed
with the necessity of scrupulously comparing
speculative results with observed facts, and of surrendering
without demur the most beloved of his fancies if it was
unable to stand this test. If Kepler had burnt three-quarters
of what he printed, we should in all probability
have formed a higher opinion of his intellectual grasp and
sobriety of judgment, but we should have lost to a great
extent the impression of extraordinary enthusiasm and
industry, and of almost unequalled intellectual honesty,
which we now get from a study of his works.</p>

<p><a id="para_152"></a>152. Between the publication of Galilei’s <i>Two New
Sciences</i> (1638) and that of Newton’s <i>Principia</i> (1687) a
period of not quite half a century elapsed; during this
interval no astronomical discovery of first-rate importance
was published, but steady progress was made on lines
already laid down.</p>

<p>On the one hand, while the impetus given to exact observation
by Tycho Brahe had not yet spent itself, the invention
of the telescope and its gradual improvement opened out an
almost indefinite field for possible discovery of new celestial
objects of interest. On the other hand, the remarkable
character of the three laws in which Kepler had summed
up the leading characteristics of the planetary motions
could hardly fail to suggest to any intelligent astronomer
the question <i>why</i> these particular laws should hold, or, in
other words, to stimulate the inquiry into the possibility of
shewing them to be necessary consequences of some
simpler and more fundamental law or laws, while Galilei’s
researches into the laws of motion suggested the possibility
of establishing some connection between the causes underlying
these celestial motions and those of ordinary terrestrial
objects.</p>

<p><a id="para_153"></a>153. It has been already mentioned how closely Galilei
was followed by other astronomers (if not in some cases
actually anticipated) in most of his telescopic discoveries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
To his rival Christopher Scheiner (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_124">§§&nbsp;124</a>, 125)
belongs the credit of the discovery of bright cloud-like
objects on the sun, chiefly visible near its edge, and from
their brilliancy named <b>faculae</b> (little torches). Scheiner made
also a very extensive series of observations of the motions
and appearances of spots.</p>

<p>The study of the surface of the moon was carried on
with great care by <i>John Hevel</i> of Danzig (1611-1687), who
published in 1647 his <i>Selenographia</i>, or description of the
moon, magnificently illustrated by plates engraved as well
as drawn by himself. The chief features of the moon—mountains,
craters, and the dark spaces then believed to be
seas—were systematically described and named, for the
most part after corresponding features of our own earth.
Hevel’s names for the chief mountain ranges, <i>e.g.</i> the
<i>Apennines</i> and the <i>Alps</i>, and for the seas, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Mare
Serenitatis</i> or Pacific Ocean, have lasted till to-day; but
similar names given by him to single mountains and craters
have disappeared, and they are now called after various
distinguished men of science and philosophers, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Plato</i>
and <i>Coppernicus</i>, in accordance with a system introduced
by <i>John Baptist Riccioli</i> (1598-1671) in his bulky treatise
on astronomy called the <i>New Almagest</i> (1651).</p>

<p>Hevel, who was an indefatigable worker, published two
large books on comets, <i>Prodromus Cometicus</i> (1654) and
<i>Cometographia</i> (1668), containing the first systematic account
of all recorded comets. He constructed also a catalogue
of about 1,500 stars, observed on the whole with accuracy
rather greater than Tycho’s, though still without the use of
the telescope; he published in addition an improved set
of tables of the sun, and a variety of other calculations and
observations.</p>

<p><a id="para_154"></a>154. The planets were also watched with interest by a
number of observers, who detected at different times bright
or dark markings on Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. The two
appendages of Saturn which Galilei had discovered in 1610
and had been unable to see two years later (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_123">§&nbsp;123</a>)
were seen and described by a number of astronomers
under a perplexing variety of appearances, and the mystery
was only unravelled, nearly half a century after Galilei’s first
observation, by the greatest astronomer of this period,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
<i>Christiaan Huygens</i> (1629-1695), a native of the Hague.
Huygens possessed remarkable ability, both practical and
theoretical, in several different directions, and his contributions
to astronomy were only a small part of his services
to science. Having acquired the art of grinding lenses
with unusual accuracy, he was able to construct telescopes
of much greater power than his predecessors. By the help of
one of these instruments he discovered in 1655 a satellite of
Saturn (<i>Titan</i>). With one of those remnants of mediaeval
mysticism from which even the soberest minds of the century
freed themselves with the greatest difficulty, he asserted that,
as the total number of planets and satellites now reached the
perfect number 12, no more remained to be discovered—a
prophecy which has been abundantly falsified since (§&nbsp;160;
chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_253">§§&nbsp;253</a>, 255; chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_289">§§&nbsp;289</a>, 294, 295).</p>

<p>Using a still finer telescope, and aided by his acuteness
in interpreting his observations, Huygens made the much
more interesting discovery that the puzzling appearances
seen round Saturn were due to a thin ring (fig. 64) inclined at
a considerable angle (estimated by him at 31°) to the plane
of the ecliptic, and therefore also to the plane in which
Saturn’s path round the sun lies. This result was first
announced—according to the curious custom of the time—by
an anagram, in the same pamphlet in which the discovery
of the satellite was published, <i>De Saturni Luna
Observatio Nova</i> (1656); and three years afterwards (1659)
the larger <i>Systema Saturnium</i> appeared, in which the interpretation
of the anagram was given, and the varying
appearances seen both by himself and by earlier observers
were explained with admirable lucidity and thoroughness.
The ring being extremely thin is invisible either when
its edge is presented to the observer or when it is presented
to the sun, because in the latter position the rest
of the ring catches no light. Twice in the course of
Saturn’s revolution round the sun (at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span> in fig. 66),
<i>i.e.</i> at intervals of about 15 years, the plane of the ring
passes for a short time through or very close both to the
earth and to the sun, and at these two periods the ring is
consequently invisible (fig. 65). Near these positions (as at
<span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>) the ring appears much foreshortened, and presents
the appearance of two arms projecting from the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
of Saturn; farther off still the ring appears wider and the
opening becomes visible; and about seven years before
and after the periods of invisibility (at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) the ring
is seen at its widest. Huygens gives for comparison with
his own results a number of drawings by earlier observers
(reproduced in fig. 67), from which it may be seen how
near some of them were to the discovery of the ring.</p>

<p><a id="para_155"></a>155. To our countryman <i>William Gascoigne</i> (1612?-1644)
is due the first recognition that the telescope could be utilised,
not merely for observing generally the appearances of celestial
bodies, but also as an instrument of precision, which would
give the directions of stars, etc., with greater accuracy than
is possible with the naked eye, and would magnify small
angles in such a way as to facilitate the measurement
of angular distances between neighbouring stars, of the
diameters of the planets, and of similar quantities. He was
unhappily killed when quite a young man at the battle
of Marston Moor (1644), but his letters, published many
years afterwards shew that by 1640 he was familiar with
the use of telescopic “sights,” for determining with
accuracy the position of a star, and that he had constructed
a so-called <b>micrometer</b><a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> with which he was able to measure
angles of a few seconds. Nothing was known of his discoveries
at the time, and it was left for Huygens to invent
independently a micrometer of an inferior kind (1658), and
for <i>Adrien Auzout</i> (?-1691) to introduce as an improvement
(about 1666) an instrument almost identical with Gascoigne’s.</p>

<p>The systematic use of telescopic sights for the regular
work of an observatory was first introduced about 1667 by
Auzout’s friend and colleague <i>Jean Picard</i> (1620-1682).</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 202.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_156"></a>156. With Gascoigne should be mentioned his friend
<i>Jeremiah Horrocks</i> (1617?-1641), who was an enthusiastic
admirer of Kepler and had made a considerable improvement
in the theory of the moon, by taking the elliptic orbit
as a basis and then allowing for various irregularities. He
was the first observer of a transit of Venus, <i>i.e.</i> a passage
of Venus over the disc of the sun, an event which took
place in 1639, contrary to the prediction of Kepler in the
<i>Rudolphine Tables</i>, but in accordance with the rival tables<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
of <i>Philips von Lansberg</i> (1561-1632) which Horrocks had
verified for the purpose. It was not, however, till long
afterwards that Halley pointed out the importance of the
transit of Venus as a means of ascertaining the distance of
the sun from the earth (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_202">§&nbsp;202</a>). It is also worth
noticing that Horrocks suggested the possibility of the
irregularities of the moon’s motion being due to the disturbing
action of the sun, and that he also had some idea of
certain irregularities in the motion of Jupiter and Saturn,
now known to be due to their mutual attraction (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>,
§&nbsp;204; chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_243">§&nbsp;243</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_157"></a>157. Another of Huygens’s discoveries revolutionised the
art of exact astronomical observation. This was the invention
of the pendulum-clock (made 1656, patented in 1657).
It has been already mentioned how the same discovery
was made by Bürgi, but virtually lost (see chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_98">§&nbsp;98</a>);
and how Galilei again introduced the pendulum as a time-measurer
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_114">§&nbsp;114</a>). Galilei’s pendulum, however,
could only be used for measuring very short times, as there
was no mechanism to keep it in motion, and the motion
soon died away. Huygens attached a pendulum to a clock
driven by weights, so that the clock kept the pendulum going
and the pendulum regulated the clock.<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> Henceforward
it was possible to take reasonably accurate time-observations,
and, by noticing the interval between the passage
of two stars across the meridian, to deduce, from the known
rate of motion of the celestial sphere, their angular distance
east and west of one another, thus helping to fix the position
of one with respect to the other. It was again Picard (<a href="#para_155">§&nbsp;155</a>)
who first recognised the astronomical importance of this
discovery, and introduced regular time-observations at the
new Observatory of Paris.</p>

<p><a id="para_158"></a>158. Huygens was not content with this practical use
of the pendulum, but worked out in his treatise called
<i>Oscillatorium Horologium</i> or <i>The Pendulum Clock</i> (1673) a
number of important results in the theory of the pendulum,
and in the allied problems connected with the motion of
a body in a circle or other curve. The greater part of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
investigations lie outside the field of astronomy, but his
formula connecting the time of oscillation of a pendulum
with its length and the intensity of gravity<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> (or, in other
words, the rate of falling of a heavy body) afforded a practical
means of measuring gravity, of far greater accuracy
than any direct experiments on falling bodies; and his
study of circular motion, leading to the result that a body
moving in a circle must be acted on by some force towards
the <i>centre</i>, the magnitude of which depended in a definite
way on the speed of the body and the size of the circle,<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> is
of fundamental importance in accounting for the planetary
motions by gravitation.</p>

<p><a id="para_159"></a>159. During the 17th century also the first measurements
of the earth were made which were a definite advance on
those of the Greeks and Arabs (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_36">§§&nbsp;36</a>, 45,
and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_57">§&nbsp;57</a>). <i>Willebrord Snell</i> (1591-1626), best
known by his discovery of the law of refraction of light,
made a series of measurements in Holland in 1617, from
which the length of a degree of a meridian appeared to be
about 67 miles, an estimate subsequently altered to about
69 miles by one of his pupils, who corrected some errors
in the calculations, the result being then within a few
hundred feet of the value now accepted. Next, <i>Richard
Norwood</i> (1590?-1675) measured the distance from London
to York, and hence obtained (1636) the length of the
degree with an error of less than half a mile. Lastly,
Picard in 1671 executed some measurements near Paris
leading to a result only a few yards wrong. The length
of a degree being known, the circumference and radius of
the earth can at once be deduced.</p>

<p><a id="para_160"></a>160. Auzout and Picard were two members of a group
of observational astronomers working at Paris, of whom the
best known, though probably not really the greatest, was
<i>Giovanni Domenico Cassini</i> (1625-1712). Born in the
north of Italy, he acquired a great reputation, partly by
some rather fantastic schemes for the construction of
gigantic instruments, partly by the discovery of the rotation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
of Jupiter (1665), of Mars (1666), and possibly of Venus
(1667), and also by his tables of the motions of Jupiter’s
moons (1668). The last caused Picard to procure for him
an invitation from Louis XIV. (1669) to come to Paris
and to exercise a general superintendence over the Observatory,
which was then being built and was substantially
completed in 1671. Cassini was an industrious observer
and a voluminous writer, with a remarkable talent for
impressing the scientific public as well as the Court. He
possessed a strong sense of the importance both of himself
and of his work, but it is more than doubtful if he had as
clear ideas as Picard of the really important pieces of work
which ought to be done at a public observatory, and of
the way to set about them. But, notwithstanding these
defects, he rendered valuable services to various departments
of astronomy. He discovered four new satellites of Saturn:
<i>Japetus</i> in 1671, <i>Rhea</i> in the following year, <i>Dione</i> and
<i>Thetis</i> in 1684; and also noticed in 1675 a dark marking
in Saturn’s ring, which has subsequently been more distinctly
recognised as a division of the ring into two, an
inner and an outer, and is known as Cassini’s division
(see fig. 95 facing p. 384). He also improved to some
extent the theory of the sun, calculated a fresh table of
atmospheric refraction which was an improvement on
Kepler’s (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_138">§&nbsp;138</a>), and issued in 1693 a fresh set
of tables of Jupiter’s moons, which were much more accurate
than those which he had published in 1668, and much the
best existing.</p>

<p><a id="para_161"></a>161. It was probably at the suggestion of Picard or Cassini
that one of their fellow astronomers, <i>John Richer</i> (?-1696),
otherwise almost unknown, undertook (1671-3) a scientific
expedition to Cayenne (in latitude 5° N.). Two important
results were obtained. It was found that a pendulum of
given length beat more slowly at Cayenne than at Paris,
thus shewing that the intensity of gravity was less near the
equator than in higher latitudes. This fact suggested that the
earth was not a perfect sphere, and was afterwards used in
connection with theoretical investigations of the problem of
the earth’s shape (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_187">§&nbsp;187</a>). Again, Richer’s
observations of the position of Mars in the sky, combined
with observations taken at the same time Cassini, Picard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
and others in France, led to a reasonably accurate estimate
of the distance of Mars and hence of that of the sun.
Mars was at the time in opposition (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§&nbsp;43</a>), so
that it was nearer to the earth
than at other times (as shewn
in fig. 68), and therefore
favourably situated for such
observations. The principle
of the method is extremely
simple and substantially identical
with that long used in
the case of the moon (chapter
<span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_49">§&nbsp;49</a>). One observer
is, say, at Paris (<span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, in fig. 69),
and observes the direction in
which Mars appears, <i>i.e.</i> the
direction of the line <span class="smcap lowercase">P M</span>; the
other at Cayenne (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) observes similarly the direction of
the line <span class="smcap lowercase">C M</span>. The line <span class="smcap lowercase">C P</span>, joining Paris and Cayenne, is
known geographically; the shape of the triangle <span class="smcap lowercase">C P M</span> and
the length of one of its sides being thus known, the
lengths of the other sides are readily calculated.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>—The parallax of a planet.</div>
</div>

<p>The result of an investigation of this sort is often most
conveniently expressed by means of a certain angle, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
which the distance in terms of the radius of the earth, and
hence in miles, can readily be deduced when desired.</p>

<p>The parallax of a heavenly body such as the moon, the
sun, or a planet, being in the first instance defined generally
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_43">§&nbsp;43</a>) as the angle (<span class="smcap lowercase">O M P</span>) between the lines
joining the heavenly body to the observer and to the
centre of the earth, varies in general with the position of
the observer. It is evidently greatest when the observer
is in such a position, as at <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>, that the line <span class="smcap lowercase">M Q</span> touches the
earth; in this position <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> is on the observer’s horizon.
Moreover the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">O Q M</span> being a right angle, the shape
of the triangle and the ratio of its sides are completely
known when the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">O M Q</span> is known. Since this angle
is the parallax of <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, when on the observer’s horizon, it is
called the <b>horizontal parallax</b> of <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, but the word horizontal
is frequently omitted. It is easily seen by a figure that
the more distant a body is the smaller is its horizontal
parallax; and with the small parallaxes with which we are
concerned in astronomy, the distance and the horizontal
parallax can be treated as inversely proportional to one
another; so that if, for example, one body is twice as
distant as another, its parallax is half as great, and so on.</p>

<p>It may be convenient to point out here that the word
“parallax” is used in a different though analogous sense when
a fixed star is in question. The apparent displacement
of a fixed star due to the earth’s motion (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_92">§&nbsp;92</a>),
which was not actually detected till long afterwards
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_278">§&nbsp;278</a>), is called <b>annual</b> or <b>stellar parallax</b>
(the adjective being frequently omitted); and the name
is applied in particular to the greatest angle between the
direction of the star as seen from the sun and as seen from
the earth in the course of the year. If in fig. 69 we regard
<span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> as representing a star, <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span> the sun, and the circle as being
the earth’s path round the sun, then the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">O M Q</span> is the
annual parallax of <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>.</p>

<p>In this particular case Cassini deduced from Richer’s
observations, by some rather doubtful processes, that the
sun’s parallax was about 9″·5, corresponding to a distance
from the earth of about 87,000,000 miles, or about 360
times the distance of the moon, the most probable value,
according to modern estimates (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_284">§&nbsp;284</a>), being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
a little less than 93,000,000. Though not really an accurate
result, this was an enormous improvement on anything
that had gone before, as Ptolemy’s estimate of the sun’s
distance, corresponding to a parallax of 3′, had survived
up to the earlier part of the 17th century, and although
it was generally believed to be seriously wrong, most
corrections of it had been purely conjectural (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>,
<a href="#para_145">§§&nbsp;145</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_162"></a>162. Another famous discovery associated with the early
days of the Paris Observatory was that of the velocity
of light. In 1671 Picard paid a visit to Denmark to
examine what was left of Tycho Brahe’s observatory at
Hveen, and brought back a young Danish astronomer,
<i>Olaus Roemer</i> (1644-1710), to help him at Paris. Roemer,
in studying the motion of Jupiter’s moons, observed (1675)
that the intervals between successive eclipses of a moon
(the eclipse being caused by the passage of the moon into
Jupiter’s shadow) were regularly less when Jupiter and the
earth were approaching one another than when they were
receding. This he saw to be readily explained by the
supposition that light travels through space at a definite
though very great speed. Thus if Jupiter is approaching
the earth, the time which the light from one of his moons
takes to reach the earth is gradually decreasing, and consequently
the interval between successive eclipses as seen
by us is apparently diminished. From the difference of
the intervals thus observed and the known rates of motion
of Jupiter and of the earth, it was thus possible to form a
rough estimate of the rate at which light travels. Roemer
also made a number of instrumental improvements of
importance, but they are of too technical a character to
be discussed here.</p>

<p><a id="para_163"></a>163. One great name belonging to the period dealt with
in this chapter remains to be mentioned, that of <i>René
Descartes</i><a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> (1596-1650). Although he ranks as a great
philosopher, and also made some extremely important
advances in pure mathematics, his astronomical writings
were of little value and in many respects positively harmful.
In his <i>Principles of Philosophy</i> (1644) he gave, among
some wholly erroneous propositions, a fuller and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
general statement of the first law of motion discovered
by Galilei (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_130">§§&nbsp;130</a>, 133), but did not support it
by any evidence of value. The same book contained an
exposition of his famous theory of vortices, which was an
attempt to explain the motions of the bodies of the solar
system by means of a certain combination of vortices or
eddies. The theory was unsupported by any experimental
evidence, and it was not formulated accurately enough to
be capable of being readily tested by comparison with
actual observation; and, unlike many erroneous theories
(such as the Greek epicycles), it in no way led up to
or suggested the truer theories which followed it. But
“Cartesianism,” both in philosophy and in natural science,
became extremely popular, especially in France, and its
vogue contributed notably to the overthrow of the authority
of Aristotle, already shaken by thinkers like Galilei and
Bacon, and thus rendered men’s minds a little more ready
to receive new ideas: in this indirect way, as well as by
his mathematical discoveries, Descartes probably contributed
something to astronomical progress.</p>

<p><a id="para_164"></a>164. Newton’s life may be conveniently divided into three
portions. First came 22 years (1643-1665) of boyhood
and undergraduate life; then followed his great productive
period, of almost exactly the same length, culminating in
the publication of the <i>Principia</i> in 1687; while the rest of
his life (1687-1727), which lasted nearly as long as the
other two periods put together, was largely occupied with
official work and studies of a non-scientific character, and
was marked by no discoveries ranking with those made
in his middle period, though some of his earlier work
received important developments and several new results
of decided interest were obtained.</p>

<p><a id="para_165"></a>165. Isaac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe, near
Grantham, in Lincolnshire, on January 4th, 1643;<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> this
was very nearly a year after the death of Galilei, and a
few months after the beginning of our Civil Wars. His
taste for study does not appear to have developed very
early in life, but ultimately became so marked that, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
some unsuccessful attempts to turn him into a farmer, he
was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661.</p>

<p>Although probably at first rather more backward than
most undergraduates, he made extremely rapid progress
in mathematics and allied subjects, and evidently gave his
teachers some trouble by the rapidity with which he
absorbed what little they knew. He met with Euclid’s
<i>Elements of Geometry</i> for the first time while an undergraduate,
but is reported to have soon abandoned it as
being “a trifling book,” in favour of more advanced reading.
In January 1665 graduated in the ordinary course as
Bachelor of Arts.</p>

<p><a id="para_166"></a>166. The external events of Newton’s life during the
next 22 years may be very briefly dismissed. He was
elected a Fellow in 1667, became M.A. in due course in
the following year, and was appointed Lucasian Professor
of Mathematics, in succession to his friend Isaac Barrow,
in 1669. Three years later he was elected a Fellow of the
recently founded Royal Society. With the exception of
some visits to his Lincolnshire home, he appears to have
spent almost the whole period in quiet study at Cambridge,
and the history of his life is almost exclusively the history
of his successive discoveries.</p>

<p><a id="para_167"></a>167. His scientific work falls into three main groups,
astronomy (including dynamics), optics, and pure mathematics.
He also spent a good deal of time on experimental
work in chemistry, as well as on heat and other branches
of physics, and in the latter half of his life devoted much
attention to questions of chronology and theology; in none
of these subjects, however, did he produce results of much
importance.</p>

<p><a id="para_168"></a>168. In forming an estimate of Newton’s genius it is of
course important to bear in mind the range of subjects
with which he dealt; from our present point of view, however,
his mathematics only presents itself as a tool to be
used in astronomical work; and only those of his optical
discoveries which are of astronomical importance need be
mentioned here. In 1668 he constructed a <b>reflecting
telescope</b>, that is, a telescope in which the rays of light from
the object viewed are concentrated by means of a curved
mirror instead of by a lens, as in the <b>refracting telescopes</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
of Galilei and Kepler. Telescopes on this principle, differing
however in some important particulars from Newton’s,
had already been described in 1663 by <i>James Gregory</i>
(1638-1675), with whose ideas Newton was acquainted, but
it does not appear that Gregory had actually made an
instrument. Owing to mechanical difficulties in construction,
half a century elapsed before reflecting telescopes were
made which could compete with the best refractors of the
time, and no important astronomical discoveries were made
with them before the time of William Herschel (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>),
more than a century after the original invention.</p>

<p>Newton’s discovery of the effect of a prism in resolving
a beam of white light into different colours is in a sense
the basis of the method of spectrum analysis (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>,
<a href="#para_299">§&nbsp;299</a>), to which so many astronomical discoveries of the
last 40 years are due.</p>

<p><a id="para_169"></a>169. The ideas by which Newton is best known in each
of his three great subjects—gravitation, his theory of
colours, and fluxions—seem to have occurred to him
and to have been partly thought out within less than two
years after he took his degree, that is before he was 24.
His own account—written many years afterwards—gives
a vivid picture of his extraordinary mental activity at this
time:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“In the beginning of the year 1665 I found the method of
approximating Series and the Rule for reducing any dignity of
any Binomial into such a series. The same year in May I
found the method of tangents of Gregory and Slusius, and in
November had the direct method of Fluxions, and the next
year in January had the Theory of Colours, and in May following
I had entrance into the inverse method of Fluxions. And the
same year I began to think of gravity extending to the orb
of the Moon, and having found out how to estimate the force
with which [a] globe revolving within a sphere presses the
surface of the sphere, from Kepler’s Rule of the periodical times
of the Planets being in a sesquialterate proportion of their
distances from the centers of their orbs I deduced that the
forces which keep the Planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally
as the squares of their distances from the centers about which
they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep
the Moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface
of the earth, and found them answer pretty nearly. All this
was in the two plague years of 1665 and 1666, for in those
days I was in the prime of my age for invention, and minded
Mathematicks and Philosophy more than at any time since.”<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_170"></a>170. He spent a considerable part of this time (1665-1666)
at Woolsthorpe, on account of the prevalence of
the plague.</p>

<p>The well-known story, that he was set meditating on
gravity by the fall of an apple in the orchard, is based
on good authority, and is perfectly credible in the sense
that the apple may have reminded him at that particular
time of certain problems connected with gravity. That
the apple seriously suggested to him the existence of the
problems or any key to their solution is wildly improbable.</p>

<p>Several astronomers had already speculated on the
“cause” of the known motions of the planets and satellites;
that is they had attempted to exhibit these motions as
consequences of some more fundamental and more general
laws. Kepler, as we have seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_150">§&nbsp;150</a>), had
pointed out that the motions in question should not be
considered as due to the influence of mere geometrical
points, such as the centres of the old epicycles, but to
that of other bodies; and in particular made some attempt
to explain the motion of the planets as due to a special
kind of influence emanating from the sun. He went,
however, entirely wrong by looking for a force to keep
up the motion of the planets and as it were push them
along. Galilei’s discovery that the motion of a body
goes on indefinitely unless there is some cause at work
to alter or stop it, at once put a new aspect on this as
on other mechanical problems; but he himself did not
develop his idea in this particular direction. <i>Giovanni
Alfonso Borelli</i> (1608-1679), in a book on Jupiter’s satellites
published in 1666, and therefore about the time of Newton’s
first work on the subject, pointed out that a body revolving
in a circle (or similar curve) had a tendency to recede
from the centre, and that in the case of the planets this
might be supposed to be counteracted by some kind of
attraction towards the sun. We have then here the idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>—
in a very indistinct form certainly—that the motion of a
planet is to be explained, not by a force acting in the
direction in which it is moving, but by a force directed
towards the sun, that is about at right angles to the
direction of the planet’s motion. Huygens carried this
idea much further—though without special reference to
astronomy—and obtained (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_158">§&nbsp;158</a>) a numerical
measure for the tendency of a body moving in a circle
to recede from the centre, a tendency which had in some
way to be counteracted if the body was not to fly away.
Huygens published his work in 1673, some years after
Newton had obtained his corresponding result, but before
he had published anything; and there can be no doubt
that the two men worked quite independently.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<a id="Fig_70"></a>
<img src="images/i_p214.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>—Motion in a circle.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_171"></a>171. Viewed as a purely general question, apart from
its astronomical applications, the problem may be said to
be to examine under
what conditions a body
can revolve with uniform
speed in a circle.</p>

<p>Let <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> represent the
position at a certain
instant of a body which
is revolving with uniform
speed in a circle of
centre <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>. Then at this
instant the body is
moving in the direction
of the tangent <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <i>a</i> to
the circle. Consequently
by Galilei’s First
Law (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>,
§§&nbsp;130, 133), if left to
itself and uninfluenced by any other body, it would continue
to move with the same speed and in the same
direction, <i>i.e.</i> along the line <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> <i>a</i>, and consequently would
be found after some time at such a point as <i>a</i>. But
actually it is found to be at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> on the circle. Hence some
influence must have been at work to bring it to <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> instead
of to <i>a</i>. But <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> is nearer to the centre of the circle than
<i>a</i> is; hence some influence must be at work tending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
constantly to draw the body towards <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, or counteracting
the tendency which it has, in virtue of the First Law of
Motion, to get farther and farther away from <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>. To
express either of these tendencies numerically we want a
more complex idea than that of velocity or rate of motion,
namely <b>acceleration</b> or rate of change of velocity, an idea
which Galilei added to science in his discussion of the
law of falling bodies (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_116">§§&nbsp;116</a>, 133). A falling
body, for example, is moving after one second with the
velocity of about 32 feet per second, after two seconds
with the velocity of 64, after three seconds with the velocity
of 96, and so on; thus in every second it gains a downward
velocity of 32 feet per second; and this may be expressed
otherwise by saying that the body has a downward acceleration
of 32 feet per second per second. A further investigation
of the motion in a circle shews that the motion
is completely explained if the moving body has, in addition
to its original velocity, an acceleration of a certain magnitude
<i>directed towards the centre of the circle</i>. It can be shewn
further that the acceleration may be numerically expressed
by taking the square of the velocity of the moving body
(expressed, say, in feet per second), and dividing this by
the radius of the circle in feet. If, for example, the body
is moving in a circle having a radius of four feet, at the
rate of ten feet a second, then the acceleration towards
the centre is (10 × 10)∕4 = 25 feet per second per second.</p>

<p>These results, with others of a similar character, were
first published by Huygens—not of course precisely in this
form—in his book on the <i>Pendulum Clock</i> (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>,
<a href="#para_158">§&nbsp;158</a>); and discovered independently by Newton in 1666.</p>

<p>If then a body is seen to move in a circle, its motion
becomes intelligible if some other body can be discovered
which produces this acceleration. In a common case, such
as when a stone is tied to a string and whirled round,
this acceleration is produced by the string which pulls
the stone; in a spinning-top the acceleration of the outer
parts is produced by the forces binding them on to the
inner part, and so on.</p>

<p><a id="para_172"></a>172. In the most important cases of this kind which
occur in astronomy, a planet is known to revolve round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
the sun in a path which does not differ much from a
circle. If we assume for the present that the path is
actually a circle, the planet must have an acceleration towards
the centre, and it is possible to attribute this to the
influence of the central body, the sun. In this way arises
the idea of attributing to the sun the power of influencing
in some way a planet which revolves round it, so as to
give it an acceleration towards the sun; and the question
at once arises of how this “influence” differs at different
distances. To answer this question Newton made use of
Kepler’s Third Law (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_144">§&nbsp;144</a>). We have seen
that, according to this law, the squares of the times of
revolution of any two planets are proportional to the cubes
of their distances from the sun; but the velocity of the
planet may be found by dividing the length of the path
it travels in its revolution round the sun by the time of
the revolution, and this length is again proportional to the
distance of the planet from the sun. Hence the velocities
of the two planets are proportional to their distances from
the sun, divided by the times of revolution, and consequently
the squares of the velocities are proportional to
the squares of the distances from the sun divided by the
squares of the times of revolution. Hence, by Kepler’s
law, the squares of the velocities are proportional to the
squares of the distances divided by the cubes of the distances,
that is the squares of the velocities are <i>inversely</i>
proportional to the distances, the more distant planet
having the less velocity and <i>vice versa</i>. Now by the
formula of Huygens the acceleration is measured by the
square of the velocity divided by the radius of the circle
(which in this case is the distance of the planet from the
sun). The accelerations of the two planets towards the
sun are therefore inversely proportional to the distances
each multiplied by itself, that is are inversely proportional
to the squares of the distances. Newton’s first result
therefore is: that the motions of the planets—regarded as
moving in circles, and in strict accordance with Kepler’s
Third Law—can be explained as due to the action of the
sun, if the sun is supposed capable of producing on a
planet an acceleration towards the sun itself which is
proportional to the inverse square of its distance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the sun; <i>i.e.</i> at twice the distance it is 1∕4 as great, at three
times the distance 1∕9 as great, at ten times the distance 1∕100
as great, and so on.</p>

<p>The argument may perhaps be made clearer by a
numerical example. In round numbers Jupiter’s distance
from the sun is five times as great as that of the earth,
and Jupiter takes 12 years to perform a revolution round
the sun, whereas the earth takes one. Hence Jupiter goes
in 12 years five times as far as the earth goes in one, and
Jupiter’s velocity is therefore about 5∕12 that of the earth’s,
or the two velocities are in the ratio of 5 to 12; the
squares of the velocities are therefore as 5 × 5 to 12 × 12,
or as 25 to 144. The accelerations of Jupiter and of the
earth towards the sun are therefore as 25 ÷ 5 to 144,
or as 5 to 144; hence Jupiter’s acceleration towards the
sun is about 1∕28 earth, and if we had taken
more accurate figures this fraction would have come out
more nearly 1∕25. Hence at five times the distance the
acceleration is 25 times less.</p>

<p>This <b>law of the inverse square</b>, as it may be called, is
also the law according to which the light emitted from the
sun or any other bright body varies, and would on this
account also be not unlikely to suggest itself in connection
with any kind of influence emitted from the sun.</p>

<p><a id="para_173"></a>173. The next step in Newton’s investigation was to see
whether the motion of the moon round the earth could be
explained in some similar way. By the same argument as
before, the moon could be shewn to have an acceleration
towards the earth. Now a stone if let drop falls downwards,
that is in the direction of the centre of the earth,
and, as Galilei had shewn (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_133">§&nbsp;133</a>), this
motion is one of uniform acceleration; if, in accordance
with the opinion generally held at that time, the motion
is regarded as being due to the earth, we may say that
the earth has the power of giving an acceleration towards
its own centre to bodies near its surface. Newton noticed
that this power extended at any rate to the tops of mountains,
and it occurred to him that it might possibly extend
as far as the moon and so give rise to the required
acceleration. Although, however, the acceleration of falling
bodies, as far as was known at the time, was the same for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
terrestrial bodies wherever situated, it was probable that
at such a distance as that of the moon the acceleration
caused by the earth would be much less. Newton assumed
as a working hypothesis that the acceleration diminished
according to the same law which he had previously arrived
at in the case of the sun’s action on the planets, that is
that the acceleration produced by the earth on any body
is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of
the body from the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>It may be noticed that a difficulty arises here which did
not present itself in the corresponding case of the planets.
The distances of the planets from the sun being large
compared with the size of the sun, it makes little difference
whether the planetary distances are measured from the
centre of the sun or from any other point in it. The same
is true of the moon and earth; but when we are comparing
the action of the earth on the moon with that on a stone
situated on or near the ground, it is clearly of the utmost
importance to decide whether the distance of the stone
is to be measured from the nearest point of the earth,
a few feet off, from the centre of the earth, 4000 miles
off, or from some other point. Provisionally at any rate
Newton decided on measuring from the centre of the
earth.</p>

<p>It remained to verify his conjecture in the case of the
moon by a numerical calculation; this could easily be done
if certain things were known, <i>viz.</i> the acceleration of a
falling body on the earth, the distance of the surface of
the earth from its centre, the distance of the moon, and
the time taken by the moon to perform a revolution round
the earth. The first of these was possibly known with fair
accuracy; the last was well known; and it was also known
that the moon’s distance was about 60 times the radius of
the earth. How accurately Newton at this time knew the
size of the earth is uncertain. Taking moderately accurate
figures, the calculation is easily performed. In a month of
about 27 days the moon moves about 60 times as far as
the distance round the earth; that is she moves about
60 × 24,000 miles in 27 days, which is equivalent to about
3,300 feet per second. The acceleration of the moon is
therefore measured by the square of this, divided by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
distance of the moon (which is 60 times the radius of the
earth, or 20,000,000 feet); that is, it is (3,300 × 3,300)∕(60 × 20,000,000),
which reduces to about 1∕110. Consequently, if the law of
the inverse square holds, the acceleration of a falling body
at the surface of the earth, which is 60 times nearer to the
centre than the moon is, should be (60 × 60)∕110, or between
32 and 33; but the actual acceleration of falling bodies
is rather more than 32. The argument is therefore
satisfactory, and Newton’s hypothesis is so far verified.</p>

<p>The analogy thus indicated between the motion of the
moon round the earth and the motion of a falling stone
may be illustrated by a comparison, due to Newton, of the
moon to a bullet shot horizontally out of a gun from a
high place on the earth. Let the bullet start from <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> in
fig. 71, then moving at first horizontally it will describe a
curved path and reach the ground at a point such as <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>,
at some distance from the point <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, vertically underneath
its starting-point. If it were shot out with a greater velocity,
its path at first would be flatter and it would reach the
ground at a point <span class="smcap lowercase">C′</span> beyond <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>; if the velocity were greater
still, it would reach the ground at <span class="smcap lowercase">C″</span> or at <span class="smcap lowercase">C‴</span>; and it
requires only a slight effort of the imagination to conceive
that, with a still greater velocity to begin with, it would miss
the earth altogether and describe a circuit round it, such
as <span class="smcap lowercase">B D E</span>. This is exactly what the moon does, the only
difference being that the moon is at a much greater distance
than we have supposed the bullet to be, and that her
motion has not been produced by anything analogous to
the gun; but the motion being once there it is immaterial
how it was produced or whether it was ever produced in
the past. We may in fact say of the moon “that she is a
falling body, only she is going so fast and is so far off that
she falls quite round to the other side of the earth, instead
of hitting it; and so goes on for ever.”<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the memorandum already quoted (<a href="#para_169">§&nbsp;169</a>) Newton
speaks of the hypothesis as fitting the facts “pretty
nearly”; but in a letter of earlier date (June 20th, 1686)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
he refers to the calculation as not having been made accurately
enough. It is probable that he used a seriously
inaccurate value of the size of the earth, having overlooked
the measurements of Snell and Norwood (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>,
<a href="#para_159">§&nbsp;159</a>); it is known that even at a later stage he was unable
to deal satisfactorily with the difficulty above mentioned,
as to whether the earth might for the purposes of the
problem be identified with its centre; and he was of course
aware that the moon’s path differed considerably from a
circle. The view, said to have been derived from Newton’s
conversation many years afterwards, that he was so dissatisfied
with his results as to regard his hypothesis as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
substantially defective, is possible, but by no means certain;
whatever the cause may have been, he laid the subject
aside for some years without publishing anything on it, and
devoted himself chiefly to optics and mathematics.</p>

<p><a id="para_174"></a>174. Meanwhile the problem of the planetary motions
was one of the numerous subjects of discussion among the
remarkable group of men who were the leading spirits of
the Royal Society, founded in 1662. <i>Robert Hooke</i> (1635-1703),
who claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries
of the time, suggested with some distinctness, not
later than 1674, that the motions of the planets might be
accounted for by attraction between them and the sun, and
referred also to the possibility of the earth’s attraction on
bodies varying according to the law of the inverse square.
<i>Christopher Wren</i> (1632-1723), better known as an architect
than as a man of science, discussed some questions of this
sort with Newton in 1677, and appears also to have thought
of a law of attraction of this kind. A letter of Hooke’s to
Newton, written at the end of 1679, dealing amongst other
things with the curve which a falling body would describe,
the rotation of the earth being taken into account, stimulated
Newton, who professed that at this time his “affection to
philosophy” was “worn out,” to go on with his study of
the celestial motions. Picard’s more accurate measurement
of the earth (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_159">§&nbsp;159</a>) was now well known, and
Newton repeated his former calculation of the moon’s
motion, using Picard’s improved measurement, and found
the result more satisfactory than before.</p>

<p><a id="para_175"></a>175. At the same time (1679) Newton made a further
discovery of the utmost importance by overcoming some of
the difficulties connected with motion in a path other than
a circle.</p>

<p>He shewed that if a body moved round a central body,
in such a way that the line joining the two bodies sweeps
out equal areas in equal times, as in Kepler’s Second Law
of planetary motion (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_141">§&nbsp;141</a>), then the moving
body is acted on by an attraction directed exactly towards
the central body; and further that if the path is an ellipse,
with the central body in one focus, as in Kepler’s First Law
of planetary motion, then this attraction must vary in
different parts of the path as the inverse square of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
distance between the two bodies. Kepler’s laws of planetary
motion were in fact shewn to lead necessarily to the
conclusions that the sun exerts on a planet an attraction
inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the
planet from the sun, and that such an attraction affords a
sufficient explanation of the motion of the planet.</p>

<p>Once more, however, Newton published nothing and
“threw his calculations by, being upon other studies.”</p>

<p><a id="para_176"></a>176. Nearly five years later the matter was again brought
to his notice, on this occasion by <i>Edmund Halley</i> (chapter
<span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_199">§§&nbsp;199-205</a>), whose friendship played henceforward
an important part in Newton’s life, and whose unselfish
devotion to the great astronomer forms a pleasant contrast
to the quarrels and jealousies prevalent at that time
between so many scientific men. Halley, not knowing
of Newton’s work in 1666, rediscovered, early in 1684, the
law of the inverse square, as a consequence of Kepler’s
Third Law, and shortly afterwards discussed with Wren
and Hooke what was the curve in which a body would
move if acted on by an attraction varying according to
this law; but none of them could answer the question.<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
Later in the year Halley visited Newton at Cambridge
and learnt from him the answer. Newton had, characteristically
enough, lost his previous calculation, but was
able to work it out again and sent it to Halley a few
months afterwards. This time fortunately his attention
was not diverted to other topics; he worked out at once a
number of other problems of motion, and devoted his usual
autumn course of University lectures to the subject.
Perhaps the most interesting of the new results was that
Kepler’s Third Law, from which the law of the inverse
square had been deduced in 1666, only on the supposition
that the planets moved in circles, was equally consistent
with Newton’s law when the paths of the planets were
taken to be ellipses.</p>

<p><a id="para_177"></a>177. At the end of the year 1684 Halley went to
Cambridge again and urged Newton to publish his results.
In accordance with this request Newton wrote out, and sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
to the Royal Society, a tract called <i>Propositiones de Motu</i>,
the 11 propositions of which contained the results already
mentioned and some others relating to the motion of
bodies under attraction to a centre. Although the propositions
were given in an abstract form, it was pointed out
that certain of them applied to the case of the planets.
Further pressure from Halley persuaded Newton to give
his results a more permanent form by embodying them in
a larger book. As might have been expected, the subject
grew under his hands, and the great treatise which resulted
contained an immense quantity of material not contained
in the <i>De Motu</i>. By the middle of 1686 the rough draft
was finished, and some of it was ready for press. Halley
not only undertook to pay the expenses, but superintended
the printing and helped Newton to collect the astronomical
data which were necessary. After some delay in the press,
the book finally appeared early in July 1687, under the
title <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>.</p>

<p><a id="para_178"></a>178. The <i>Principia</i>, as it is commonly called, consists of
three books in addition to introductory matter: the first
book deals generally with problems of the motion of bodies,
solved for the most part in an abstract form without special
reference to astronomy; the second book deals with the
motion of bodies through media which resist their motion,
such as ordinary fluids, and is of comparatively small
astronomical importance, except that in it some glaring
inconsistencies in the Cartesian theory of vortices are
pointed out; the third book applies to the circumstances
of the actual solar system the results already obtained, and
is in fact an explanation of the motions of the celestial
bodies on Newton’s mechanical principles.</p>

<p><a id="para_179"></a>179. The introductory portion, consisting of “Definitions”
and “Axioms, or Laws of Motion,” forms a very notable
contribution to dynamics, being in fact the first coherent
statement of the fundamental laws according to which the
motions of bodies are produced or changed. Newton
himself does not appear to have regarded this part of
his book as of very great importance, and the chief
results embodied in it, being overshadowed as it were by
the more striking discoveries in other parts of the book,
attracted comparatively little attention. Much of it must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
passed over here, but certain results of special astronomical
importance require to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Galilei, as we have seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_130">§§&nbsp;130</a>, 133),
was the first to enunciate the law that a body when once
in motion continues to move in the same direction and
at the same speed unless some cause is at work to make
it change its motion. This law is given by Newton in
the form already quoted in §&nbsp;130, as the first of three
fundamental laws, and is now commonly known as the
First Law of Motion.</p>

<p>Galilei also discovered that a falling body moves with
continually changing velocity, but with a uniform acceleration
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_133">§&nbsp;133</a>), and that this acceleration is the
same for all bodies (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_116">§&nbsp;116</a>). The tendency of
a body to fall having been generally recognised as due
to the earth, Galilei’s discovery involved the recognition
that one effect of one body on another may be an acceleration
produced in its motion. Newton extended this idea
by shewing that the earth produced an acceleration in the
motion of the moon, and the sun in the motion of the
planets, and was led to the general idea of acceleration in
a body’s motion, which might be due in a variety of ways
to the action of other bodies, and which could conveniently
be taken as a measure of the effect produced by one body
on another.</p>

<p><a id="para_180"></a>180. To these ideas Newton added the very important
and difficult conception of <b>mass</b>.</p>

<p>If we are comparing two different bodies of the same
material but of different sizes, we are accustomed to think
of the larger one as heavier than the other. In the same
way we readily think of a ball of lead as being heavier
than a ball of wood of the same size. The most prominent
idea connected with “heaviness” and “lightness” is that
of the muscular effort required to support or to lift the
body in question; a greater effort, for example, is required
to hold the leaden ball than the wooden one. Again, the
leaden ball if supported by an elastic string stretches it
farther than does the wooden ball; or again, if they are
placed in the scales of a balance, the lead sinks and the
wood rises. All these effects we attribute to the “weight”
of the two bodies, and the weight we are mostly accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
to attribute in some way to the action of the earth on
the bodies. The ordinary process of weighing a body in
a balance shews, further, that we are accustomed to think
of weight as a measurable quantity. On the other hand,
we know from Galilei’s result, which Newton tested very
carefully by a series of pendulum experiments, that the
leaden and the wooden ball, if allowed to drop, fall with
the same acceleration. If therefore we measure the effect
which the earth produces on the two balls by their
acceleration, then the earth affects them equally; but if
we measure it by the power which they have of stretching
strings, or by the power which one has of supporting the
other in a balance, then the effect which the earth produces
on the leaden ball is greater than that produced on the
wooden ball. Taken in this way, the action of the earth
on either ball may be spoken of as weight, and the weight
of a body can be measured by comparing it in a balance
with standard bodies.</p>

<p>The difference between two such bodies as the leaden
and wooden ball may, however, be recognised in quite
a different way. We can easily see, for example, that a
greater effort is needed to set the one in motion than
the other; or that if each is tied to the end of a string
of given kind and whirled round at a given rate, the
one string is more tightly stretched than the other. In
these cases the attraction of the earth is of no importance,
and we recognise a distinction between the two bodies
which is independent of the attraction of the earth. This
distinction Newton regarded as due to a difference in
the quantity of matter or material in the two bodies,
and to this quantity he gave the name of mass. It may
fairly be doubted whether anything is gained by this particular
definition of mass, but the really important step
was the distinct recognition of mass as a property of bodies,
of fundamental importance in dynamical questions, and
capable of measurement.</p>

<p>Newton, developing Galilei’s idea, gave as one measurement
of the action exerted by one body on another the product
of the mass by the acceleration produced—a quantity
for which he used different names, now replaced by
force. The <i>weight</i> of a body was thus identified with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
force exerted on it by the earth. Since the earth produces
the same acceleration in all bodies at the same place,
it follows that the masses of bodies at the same place are
proportional to their weights; thus if two bodies are compared
at the same place, and the weight of one (as shewn,
for example, by a pair of scales) is found to be ten times
that of the other, then its mass is also ten times as
great. But such experiments as those of Richer at Cayenne
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>) shewed that the acceleration of falling
bodies was less at the equator than in higher latitudes;
so that if a body is carried from London or Paris to
Cayenne, its weight is altered but its mass remains the
same as before. Newton’s conception of the earth’s
gravitation as extending as far as the moon gave further
importance to the distinction between mass and weight;
for if a body were removed from the earth to the moon,
then its mass would be unchanged, but the acceleration
due to the earth’s attraction would be 60 × 60 times less,
and its weight diminished in the same proportion.</p>

<p>Rules are also given for the effect produced on a
body’s motion by the simultaneous action of two or more
forces.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>A further principle of great importance, of which only
very indistinct traces are to be found before Newton’s
time, was given by him as the Third Law of Motion in
the form: “To every action there is always an equal
and contrary reaction; or, the mutual actions of any two
bodies are always equal and oppositely directed.” Here
action and reaction are to be interpreted primarily in the
sense of force. If a stone rests on the hand, the force with
which the stone presses the hand downwards is equal to
that with which the hand presses the stone upwards; if
the earth attracts a stone downwards with a certain force,
then the stone attracts the earth upwards with the same
force, and so on. It is to be carefully noted that if, as
in the last example, two bodies are acting on one another,
the <i>accelerations</i> produced are not the same, but since force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
is measured by the product of mass and acceleration, the
body with the larger mass receives the lesser acceleration.
In the case of a stone and the earth, the mass of the
latter being enormously greater,<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> its acceleration is enormously
less than that of the stone, and is therefore (in
accordance with our experience) quite insensible.</p>

<p><a id="para_181"></a>181. When Newton began to write the <i>Principia</i> he had
probably satisfied himself (<a href="#para_173">§&nbsp;173</a>) that the attracting power
of the earth extended as far as the moon, and that the
acceleration thereby produced in any body—whether the
moon, or whether a body close to the earth—is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance from the centre
of the earth. With the ideas of force and mass this result
may be stated in the form: <i>the earth attracts any body with
a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance
on the earth’s centre, and also proportional to the mass of
the body</i>.</p>

<p>In the same way Newton had established that the
motions of the planets could be explained by an attraction
towards the sun producing an acceleration inversely proportional
to the square of the distance from the sun’s
centre, not only in the <i>same</i> planet in different parts of its
path, but also in <i>different</i> planets. Again, it follows from
this that the sun attracts any planet with a force inversely
proportional to the square of the distance of the planet
from the sun’s centre, and also proportional to the mass
of the planet.</p>

<p>But by the Third Law of Motion a body experiencing an
attraction towards the earth must in turn exert an equal
attraction on the earth; similarly a body experiencing an
attraction towards the sun must exert an equal attraction
on the sun. If, for example, the mass of Venus is seven
times that of Mars, then the force with which the sun
attracts Venus is seven times as great as that with which
it would attract Mars if placed at the same distance; and
therefore also the force with which Venus attracts the
sun is seven times as great as that with which Mars would
attract the sun if at an equal distance from it. Hence, in
all the cases of attraction hitherto considered and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
which the comparison is possible, the force is proportional
not only to the mass of the attracted body, but also to
that of the attracting body, as well as being inversely proportional
to the square of the distance. Gravitation thus
appears no longer as a property peculiar to the central
body of a revolving system, but as belonging to a planet
in just the same way as to the sun, and to the moon or
to a stone in just the same way as to the earth.</p>

<p>Moreover, the fact that separate bodies on the surface
of the earth are attracted by the earth, and therefore in
turn attract it, suggests that this power of attracting other
bodies which the celestial bodies are shewn to possess
does not belong to each celestial body as a whole, but to
the separate particles making it up, so that, for example,
the force with which Jupiter and the sun mutually attract
one another is the result of compounding the forces with
which the separate particles making up Jupiter attract
the separate particles making up the sun. Thus is
suggested finally the law of gravitation in its most general
form: <i>every particle of matter attracts every other particle
with a force proportional to the mass of each, and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them</i>.<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p><a id="para_182"></a>182. In all the astronomical cases already referred to
the attractions between the various celestial bodies have
been treated as if they were accurately directed towards
their centres, and the distance between the bodies has
been taken to be the distance between their centres.
Newton’s doubts on this point, in the case of the earth’s
attraction of bodies, have been already referred to (<a href="#para_173">§&nbsp;173</a>);
but early in 1685 he succeeded in justifying this assumption.
By a singularly beautiful and simple course of reasoning
he shewed (<i>Principia</i>, Book I., propositions 70, 71) that, if
a body is spherical in form and equally dense throughout,
it attracts any particle external to it exactly as if its whole
mass were concentrated at its centre. He shewed, further,
that the same is true for a sphere of variable density,
provided it can be regarded as made up of a series of
spherical shells, having a common centre, each of uniform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
density throughout, different shells being, however, of
different densities. For example, the result is true for a
hollow indiarubber ball as well as for a solid one, but
is not true for a sphere made up of a hemisphere of wood
and a hemisphere of iron fastened together.</p>

<p><a id="para_183"></a>183. The law of gravitation being thus provisionally
established, the great task which lay before Newton, and
to which he devotes the greater part of the first and third
books of the <i>Principia</i>, was that of deducing from it and
the “laws of motion” the motions of the various members
of the solar system, and of shewing, if possible, that the
motions so calculated agreed with those observed. If this
were successfully done, it would afford a verification of the
most delicate and rigorous character of Newton’s principles.</p>

<p>The conception of the solar system as a mechanism, each
member of which influences the motion of every other
member in accordance with one universal law of attraction,
although extremely simple in itself, is easily seen to give rise
to very serious difficulties when it is proposed actually to
calculate the various motions. If in dealing with the
motion of a planet such as Mars it were possible to regard
Mars as acted on only by the attraction of the sun, and to
ignore the effects of the other planets, then the problem
would be completely solved by the propositions which
Newton established in 1679 (<a href="#para_175">§&nbsp;175</a>); and by their means the
position of Mars at any time could be calculated with any
required degree of accuracy. But in the case which
actually exists the motion of Mars is affected by the forces
with which all the other planets (as well as the satellites)
attract it, and these forces in turn depend on the position of
Mars (as well as upon that of the other planets) and hence
upon the motion of Mars. A problem of this kind in all
its generality is quite beyond the powers of any existing
mathematical methods. Fortunately, however, the mass
of even the largest of the planets is so very much less than
that of the sun, that the motion of any one planet is only
slightly affected by the others; and it may be regarded as
moving very nearly as it would move if the other planets
did not exist, the effect of these being afterwards allowed
for as producing disturbances or <b>perturbations</b> in its path.
Although even in this simplified form the problem of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
motion of the planets is one of extreme difficulty (cf.
chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_228">§&nbsp;228</a>), and Newton was unable to solve it with
anything like completeness, yet he was able to point out
certain general effects which must result from the mutual
action of the planets, the most interesting being the slow
forward motion of the apses of the earth’s orbit, which had
long ago been noticed by observing astronomers (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>,
<a href="#para_59">§&nbsp;59</a>). Newton also pointed out that Jupiter, on account
of its great mass, must produce a considerable perturbation
in the motion of its neighbour Saturn, and thus gave some
explanation of an irregularity first noted by Horrocks
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_156">§&nbsp;156</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_184"></a>184. The motion of the moon presents special difficulties,
but Newton, who was evidently much interested in the
problems of lunar theory, succeeded in overcoming them
much more completely than the corresponding ones
connected with the planets.</p>

<p>The moon’s motion round the earth is primarily due to
the attraction of the earth; the perturbations due to the
other planets are insignificant; but the sun, which though
at a very great distance has an enormously greater mass
than the earth, produces a very sensible disturbing effect
on the moon’s motion. Certain irregularities, as we have
seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_40">§§&nbsp;40</a>, 48; chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_111">§&nbsp;111</a>), had already
been discovered by observation. Newton was able to
shew that the disturbing action of the sun would necessarily
produce perturbations of the same general character
as those thus recognised, and in the case of the motion of
the moon’s nodes and of her apogee he was able to get a
very fairly accurate numerical result;<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and he also discovered
a number of other irregularities, for the most part
very small, which had not hitherto been noticed. He
indicated also the existence of certain irregularities in the
motions of Jupiter’s and Saturn’s moons analogous to those
which occur in the case of our moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p><a id="para_185"></a>185. One group of results of an entirely novel character
resulted from Newton’s theory of gravitation. It became
for the first time possible to estimate the <i>masses</i> of some
of the celestial bodies, by comparing the attractions exerted
by them on other bodies with that exerted by the earth.</p>

<p>The case of Jupiter may be given as an illustration. The
time of revolution of Jupiter’s outermost satellite is known
to be about 16 days 16 hours, and its distance from
Jupiter was estimated by Newton (not very correctly) at
about four times the distance of the moon from the earth.
A calculation exactly like that of §&nbsp;172 or §&nbsp;173 shews that
the acceleration of the satellite due to Jupiter’s attraction
is about ten times as great as the acceleration of the moon
towards the earth, and that therefore, the distance being
four times as great, Jupiter attracts a body with a force
10 × 4 × 4 times as great as that with which the earth
attracts a body at the same distance; consequently Jupiter’s
mass is 160 times that of the earth. This process of
reasoning applies also to Saturn, and in a very similar way
a comparison of the motion of a planet, Venus for example,
round the sun with the motion of the moon round the
earth gives a relation between the masses of the sun and
earth. In this way Newton found the mass of the sun to
be 1067, 3021, and 169282 times greater than that of
Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, respectively. The corresponding
figures now accepted are not far from 1047, 3530,
324439. The large error in the last number is due to the
use of an erroneous value of the distance of the sun—then
not at all accurately known—upon which depend the other
distances in the solar system, except those connected with
the earth-moon system. As it was necessary for the employment
of this method to be able to observe the motion
of some other body attracted by the planet in question, it
could not be applied to the other three planets (Mars,
Venus, and Mercury), of which no satellites were known.</p>

<p><a id="para_186"></a>186. From the equality of action and reaction it follows
that, since the sun attracts the planets, they also attract the
sun, and the sun consequently is in motion, though—owing
to the comparative smallness of the planets—only to a very
small extent. It follows that Kepler’s Third Law is not
strictly accurate, deviations from it becoming sensible in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the case of the large planets Jupiter and Saturn (cf. chapter
<span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_144">§&nbsp;144</a>). It was, however, proved by Newton that
in any system of bodies, such as the solar system, moving
about in any way under the influence of their mutual
attractions, there is a particular point, called the <b>centre of
gravity</b>, which can always be treated as at rest; the sun
moves relatively to this point, but so little that the distance
between the centre of the sun and the centre of gravity can
never be much more than the diameter of the sun.</p>

<p>It is perhaps rather curious that this result was not seized
upon by some of the supporters of the Church in the condemnation
of Galilei, now rather more than half a century
old; for if it was far from supporting the view that the
earth is at the centre of the world, it at any rate negatived
that part of the doctrine of Coppernicus and Galilei which
asserted the sun to be <i>at rest</i> in the centre of the world.
Probably no one who was capable of understanding
Newton’s book was a serious supporter of any anti-Coppernican
system, though some still professed themselves
obedient to the papal decrees on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p><a id="para_187"></a>187. The variation of the time of oscillation of a
pendulum in different parts of the earth, discovered by
Richer in 1672 (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>), indicated that the
earth was probably not a sphere. Newton pointed out
that this departure from the spherical form was a consequence
of the mutual gravitation of the particles making
up the earth and of the earth’s rotation. He supposed a
canal of water to pass from the pole to the centre of the
earth, and then from the centre to a point on the equator
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B O</span> <i>a</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> in fig. 72), and then found the condition that these
two columns of water <span class="smcap lowercase">O B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">O A</span>, each being attracted towards
the centre of the earth, should balance. This method
involved certain assumptions as to the inside of the earth,
of which little can be said to be known even now, and
consequently, though Newton’s general result, that the
earth is flattened at the poles and bulges out at the equator,
was right, the actual numerical expression which he found
was not very accurate. If, in the figure, the dotted line is
a circle the radius of which is equal to the distance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
pole <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> from the centre of the earth <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, then the actual
surface of the earth extends at the equator beyond this
circle as far as <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, where, according to Newton, <i>a</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> is about
1∕230 of <span class="smcap lowercase">O B</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">O A</span>, and according to modern estimates, based
on actual measurement of the earth as well as upon theory
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_221">§&nbsp;221</a>), it is about 1∕293 of <span class="smcap lowercase">O A</span>. Both Newton’s
fraction and the modern one are so small that the resulting
flattening cannot be made sensible in a figure; in fig. 72
the length <i>a</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> is made, for the sake of distinctness, nearly
30 times as great as it should be.</p>

<img src="images/i_p234.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>—The spheroidal form of the earth.</div>
</div>

<p>Newton discovered also in a similar way the flattening
of Jupiter, which, owing to its more rapid rotation, is
considerably more flattened than the earth; this was also
detected telescopically by Domenico Cassini four years
after the publication of the <i>Principia</i>.</p>

<p><a id="para_188"></a>188. The discovery of the form of the earth led to
an explanation of the precession of the equinoxes, a
phenomenon which had been discovered 1,800 years before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>), but had remained a complete mystery
ever since.</p>

<p>If the earth is a perfect sphere, then its attraction on
any other body is exactly the same as if its mass were all
concentrated at its centre (<a href="#para_182">§&nbsp;182</a>), and so also the attraction
on it of any other body such as the sun or moon is
equivalent to a single force passing through the centre O of
the earth; but this is no longer true if the earth is not
spherical. In fact the action of the sun or moon on the
spherical part of the earth, inside the dotted circle in
fig. 72, is equivalent to a force through <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>, and has no
tendency to turn the earth in any way about its centre;
but the attraction on the remaining portion is of a different
character, and Newton shewed that from it resulted a
motion of the axis of the earth of the same general
character as precession. The amount of the precession as
calculated by Newton did as a matter of fact agree pretty
closely with the observed amount, but this was due to the
accidental compensation of two errors, arising from his
imperfect knowledge of the form and construction of the
earth, as well as from erroneous estimates of the distance
of the sun and of the mass of the moon, neither of which
quantities Newton was able to measure with any accuracy.<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
It was further pointed out that the motion in question was
necessarily not quite uniform, but that, owing to the unequal
effects of the sun in different positions, the earth’s axis
would oscillate to and fro every six months, though to a
very minute extent.</p>

<p><a id="para_189"></a>189. Newton also gave a general explanation of the tides
as due to the disturbing action of the moon and sun, the
former being the more important. If the earth be regarded
as made of a solid spherical nucleus, covered by the ocean,
then the moon attracts different parts unequally, and in
particular the attraction, measured by the acceleration produced,
on the water nearest to the moon is greater than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
that on the solid earth, and that on the water farthest from
the moon is less. Consequently the water moves on the
surface of the earth, the general character of the motion
being the same as if the portion of the ocean on the side
towards the moon were attracted and that on the opposite
side repelled. Owing to the rotation of the earth and
the moon’s motion, the moon returns to nearly the
same position with respect to any place on the earth in
a period which exceeds a day by (on the average) about 50
minutes, and consequently Newton’s argument shewed
that low tides (or high tides) due to the moon would follow
one another at any given place at intervals equal to about
half this period; or, in other words, that two tides would
in general occur daily, but that on each day any particular
phase of the tides would occur on the average about 50
minutes later than on the preceding day, a result agreeing
with observation. Similar but smaller tides were shewn
by the same argument to arise from the action of the
sun, and the actual tide to be due to the combination of
the two. It was shewn that at new and full moon the
lunar and solar tides would be added together, whereas
at the half moon they would tend to counteract one another,
so that the observed fact of greater tides every fortnight
received an explanation. A number of other peculiarities
of the tides were also shewn to result from the same
principles.</p>

<p>Newton ingeniously used observations of the height of
the tide when the sun and moon acted together and
when they acted in opposite ways to compare the tide-raising
powers of the sun and moon, and hence to estimate
the mass of the moon in terms of that of the sun, and
consequently in terms of that of the earth (<a href="#para_185">§&nbsp;185</a>). The
resulting mass of the moon was about twice what it ought
to be according to modern knowledge, but as before
Newton’s time no one knew of any method of measuring
the moon’s mass even in the roughest way, and this result
had to be disentangled from the innumerable complications
connected with both the theory and with observation of
the tides, it cannot but be regarded as a remarkable achievement.
Newton’s theory of the tides was based on certain
hypotheses which had to be made in order to render the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
problem at all manageable, but which were certainly not
true, and consequently, as he was well aware, important
modifications would necessarily have to be made, in order
to bring his results into agreement with actual facts. The
mere presence of land not covered by water is, for example,
sufficient by itself to produce important alterations in tidal
effects at different places. Thus Newton’s theory was by
no means equal to such a task as that of predicting the
times of high tide at any required place, or the height of
any required tide, though it gave a satisfactory explanation
of many of the general characteristics of tides.</p>

<p><a id="para_190"></a>190. As we have seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, §&nbsp;103; chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>,
<a href="#para_146">§&nbsp;146</a>), comets until quite recently had been commonly
regarded as terrestrial objects produced in the higher
regions of our atmosphere, and even the more enlightened
astronomers who, like Tycho, Kepler, and Galilei, recognised
them as belonging to the celestial bodies, were unable
to give an explanation of their motions and of their
apparently quite irregular appearances and disappearances.
Newton was led to consider whether a comet’s motion
could not be explained, like that of a planet, by gravitation
towards the sun. If so then, as he had proved near the
beginning of the <i>Principia</i>, its path must be either an ellipse
or one of two other allied curves, the <b>parabola</b> and
<b>hyperbola</b>. If a comet moved in an ellipse which only
differed slightly from a circle, then it would never recede
to any very great distance from the centre of the solar
system, and would therefore be regularly visible, a result
which was contrary to observation. If, however, the ellipse
was very elongated, as shewn in fig. 73, then the period
of revolution might easily be very great, and, during the
greater part of it, the comet would be so far from the sun
and consequently also from the earth as to be invisible.
If so the comet would be seen for a short time and become
invisible, only to reappear after a very long time, when
it would naturally be regarded as a new comet. If again
the path of the comet were a parabola (which may be
regarded as an ellipse indefinitely elongated), the comet
would not return at all, but would merely be seen once
when in that part of its path which is near the sun. But
if a comet moved in a parabola, with the sun in a focus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
then its positions when not very far from the sun would
be almost the same as if it moved in an elongated ellipse
(see fig. 73), and consequently it would hardly be possible
to distinguish the two cases. Newton accordingly worked
out the case of motion in a parabola, which is mathematically
the simpler, and found that, in the case of a comet
which had attracted much attention in the winter 1680-1,
a parabolic path could be found, the calculated places of
the comet in which agreed closely with those observed.
In the later editions of the <i>Principia</i> the motions of a
number of other comets were investigated with a similar
result. It was thus established that in many cases a
comet’s path is either a parabola or an elongated ellipse,
and that a similar result was to be expected in other cases.
This reduction to rule of the apparently arbitrary motions
of comets, and their inclusion with the planets in the same
class of bodies moving round the sun under the action
of gravitation, may fairly be regarded as one of the most
striking of the innumerable discoveries contained in the
<i>Principia</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_73"></a>
<img src="images/i_p238.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>—An elongated ellipse and a parabola.</div>
</div>

<p>In the same section Newton discussed also at some
length the nature of comets and in particular the structure
of their tails, arriving at the conclusion, which is in general
agreement with modern theories (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_304">§&nbsp;304</a>), that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the tail is formed by a stream of finely divided matter
of the nature of smoke, rising up from the body of the
comet, and so illuminated by the light of the sun when
tolerably near it as to become visible.</p>

<p><a id="para_191"></a>191. The <i>Principia</i> was published, as we have seen, in
1687. Only a small edition seems to have been printed,
and this was exhausted in three or four years. Newton’s
earlier discoveries, and the presentation to the Royal
Society of the tract <i>De Motu</i> (<a href="#para_177">§&nbsp;177</a>), had prepared the
scientific world to look for important new results in the
<i>Principia</i>, and the book appears to have been read by
the leading Continental mathematicians and astronomers,
and to have been very warmly received in England. The
Cartesian philosophy had, however, too firm a hold to be
easily shaken; and Newton’s fundamental principle, involving
as it did the idea of an action between two bodies
separated by an interval of empty space, seemed impossible
of acceptance to thinkers who had not yet fully grasped
the notion of judging a scientific theory by the extent
to which its consequences agree with observed facts.
Hence even so able a man as Huygens (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>,
§§&nbsp;154, 157, 158), regarded the idea of gravitation as
“absurd,” and expressed his surprise that Newton should
have taken the trouble to make such a number of laborious
calculations with no foundation but this principle, a remark
which shewed Huygens to have had no conception that
the agreement of the results of these calculations with
actual facts was proof of the soundness of the principle.
Personal reasons also contributed to the Continental neglect
of Newton’s work, as the famous quarrel between Newton
and Leibniz as to their respective claims to the invention
of what Newton called fluxions and Leibniz the differential
method (out of which the differential and integral
calculus have developed) grew in intensity and fresh combatants
were drawn into it on both sides. Half a century
in fact elapsed before Newton’s views made any substantial
progress on the Continent (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_229">§&nbsp;229</a>). In our
country the case was different; not only was the <i>Principia</i>
read with admiration by the few who were capable of
understanding it, but scholars like Bentley, philosophers
like Locke, and courtiers like Halifax all made attempts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
to grasp Newton’s general ideas, even though the details
of his mathematics were out of their range. It was moreover
soon discovered that his scientific ideas could be
used with advantage as theological arguments.</p>

<p><a id="para_192"></a>192. One unfortunate result of the great success of the
<i>Principia</i> was that Newton was changed from a quiet
Cambridge professor, with abundant leisure and a slender
income, into a public character, with a continually increasing
portion of his time devoted to public business of one
sort or another.</p>

<p>Just before the publication of the <i>Principia</i> he had been
appointed one of the representatives of his University to
defend its rights against the encroachments of James II.,
and two years later he sat as member for the University
in the Convention Parliament, though he retired after its
dissolution.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these and many other distractions, he
continued to work at the theory of gravitation, paying
particular attention to the lunar theory, a difficult subject
with his treatment of which he was never quite satisfied.<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
He was fortunately able to obtain from time to time first-rate
observations of the moon (as well as of other bodies)
from the Astronomer Royal Flamsteed (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_197">§§&nbsp;197-8</a>),
though Newton’s continual requests and Flamsteed’s occasional
refusals led to strained relations at intervals. It is
possible that about this time Newton contemplated writing
a new treatise, with more detailed treatment of various
points discussed in the <i>Principia</i>; and in 1691 there was
already some talk of a new edition of the <i>Principia</i>, possibly
to be edited by some younger mathematician. In any
case nothing serious in this direction was done for some
years, perhaps owing to a serious illness, apparently some
nervous disorder, which attacked Newton in 1692 and
lasted about two years. During this illness, as he himself
said, “he had not his usual consistency of mind,” and it is
by no means certain that he ever recovered his full mental
activity and power.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="NEWTON"></a>
<img src="images/i_p240a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">NEWTON.
<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 139.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p>Soon after recovering from this illness he made some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
preparations for a new edition of the <i>Principia</i>, besides
going on with the lunar theory, but the work was again
interrupted in 1695, when he received the valuable appointment
of Warden to the Mint, from which he was promoted
to the Mastership four years later. He had, in consequence,
to move to London (1696), and much of his time
was henceforward occupied by official duties. In 1701
he resigned his professorship at Cambridge, and in the
same year was for the second time elected the Parliamentary
representative of the University. In 1703 he was chosen
President of the Royal Society, an office which he held till
his death, and in 1705 he was knighted on the occasion of
a royal visit to Cambridge.</p>

<p>During this time he published (1704) his treatise on
<i>Optics</i>, the bulk of which was probably written long before,
and in 1709 he finally abandoned the idea of editing the
<i>Principia</i> himself, and arranged for the work to be done by
<i>Roger Cotes</i> (1682-1716), the brilliant young mathematician
whose untimely death a few years later called from Newton
the famous eulogy, “If Mr. Cotes had lived we might
have known something.” The alterations to be made were
discussed in a long and active correspondence between the
editor and author, the most important changes being
improvements and additions to the lunar theory, and to
the discussions of precession and of comets, though there
were also a very large number of minor changes; and the
new edition appeared in 1713. A third edition, edited by
Pemberton, was published in 1726, but this time Newton,
who was over 80, took much less part, and the alterations
were of no great importance. This was Newton’s last piece
of scientific work, and his death occurred in the following
year (March 3rd, 1727).</p>

<p><a id="para_193"></a>193. It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the
immense magnitude of Newton’s scientific discoveries
except by a free use of the mathematical technicalities in
which the bulk of them were expressed. The criticism
passed on him by his personal enemy Leibniz that,
“Taking mathematics from the beginning of the world
to the time when Newton lived, what he had done was
much the better half,” and the remark of his great successor
Lagrange (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_237">§&nbsp;237</a>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> “Newton was the
greatest genius that ever existed, and the most fortunate,
for we cannot find more than once a system of the world
to establish,” shew the immense respect for his work felt
by those who were most competent to judge it.</p>

<p>With these magnificent eulogies it is pleasant to compare
Newton’s own grateful recognition of his predecessors,
“If I have seen further than other men, it is because I
have stood upon the shoulders of the giants,” and his
modest estimate of his own performances:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to
myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore,
and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean
of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_194"></a>194. It is sometimes said, in explanation of the difference
between Newton’s achievements and those of earlier
astronomers, that whereas they discovered <i>how</i> the celestial
bodies moved, he shewed <i>why</i> the motions were as they
were, or, in other words, that they <i>described</i> motions while
he <i>explained</i> them or ascertained their cause. It is,
however, doubtful whether this distinction between How
and Why, though undoubtedly to some extent convenient,
has any real validity. Ptolemy, for example, represented
the motion of a planet by a certain combination of epicycles;
his scheme was equivalent to a particular method
of describing the motion; but if any one had asked him
why the planet would be in a particular position at a
particular time, he might legitimately have answered that
it was so because the planet was connected with this particular
system of epicycles, and its place could be deduced
from them by a rigorous process of calculation. But if
any one had gone further and asked why the planet’s
epicycles were as they were, Ptolemy could have given no
answer. Moreover, as the system of epicycles differed in
some important respects from planet to planet, Ptolemy’s
system left unanswered a number of questions which
obviously presented themselves. Then Coppernicus gave
a partial answer to some of these questions. To the
question why certain of the planetary motions, corresponding
to certain epicycles, existed, he would have replied that
it was because of certain motions of the earth, from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
these (apparent) planetary motions could be deduced as
necessary consequences. But the same information could
also have been given as a mere descriptive statement that
the earth moves in certain ways and the planets move in
certain other ways. But again, if Coppernicus had been
asked why the earth rotated on its axis, or why the planets
revolved round the sun, he could have given no answer;
still less could he have said why the planets had certain
irregularities in their motions, represented by his epicycles.</p>

<p>Kepler again described the same motions very much
more simply and shortly by means of his three laws of
planetary motion; but if any one had asked why a planet’s
motion varied in certain ways, he might have replied that
it was because all planets moved in ellipses so as to sweep
out equal areas in equal times. <i>Why</i> this was so Kepler
was unable to say, though he spent much time in speculating
on the subject. This question was, however, answered
by Newton, who shewed that the planetary motions were
necessary consequences of his law of gravitation and his
laws of motion. Moreover from these same laws, which
were extremely simple in statement and few in number,
followed as necessary consequences the motion of the
moon and many other astronomical phenomena, and also
certain familiar terrestrial phenomena, such as the behaviour
of falling bodies; so that a large number of groups of
observed facts, which had hitherto been disconnected from
one another, were here brought into connection as necessary
consequences of certain fundamental laws. But again
Newton’s view of the solar system might equally well be
put as a mere descriptive statement that the planets, etc.,
move with accelerations of certain magnitudes towards one
another. As, however, the actual position or rate of motion
of a planet at any time can only be deduced by an extremely
elaborate calculation from Newton’s laws, they are not at
all obviously equivalent to the observed celestial motions,
and we do not therefore at all easily think of them as being
merely a description.</p>

<p>Again Newton’s laws at once suggest the question why
bodies attract one another in this particular way; and this
question, which Newton fully recognised as legitimate, he
was unable to answer. Or again we might ask why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
planets are of certain sizes, at certain distances from the
sun, etc., and to these questions again Newton could give
no answer.</p>

<p>But whereas the questions left unanswered by Ptolemy,
Coppernicus, and Kepler were in whole or in part answered
by their successors, that is, their unexplained facts or
laws were shewn to be necessary consequences of other
simpler and more general laws, it happens that up to the
present day no one has been able to answer, in any satisfactory
way, these questions which Newton left unanswered.
In this particular direction, therefore, Newton’s laws mark
the boundary of our present knowledge. But if any one
were to succeed this year or next in shewing gravitation to
be a consequence of some still more general law, this new
law would still bring with it a new Why.</p>

<p>If, however, Newton’s laws cannot be regarded as an
ultimate explanation of the phenomena of the solar system,
except in the historic sense that they have not yet been
shewn to depend on other more fundamental laws, their
success in “explaining,” with fair accuracy, such an immense
mass of observed results in all parts of the solar system,
and their universal character, gave a powerful impetus to
the idea of accounting for observed facts in other departments
of science, such as chemistry and physics, in some
similar way as the consequence of forces acting between
bodies, and hence to the conception of the material universe
as made up of a certain number of bodies, each acting on
one another with definite forces in such a way that all the
changes which can be observed to go on are necessary
consequences of these forces, and are capable of prediction
by any one who has sufficient knowledge of the forces and
sufficient mathematical skill to develop their consequences.</p>

<p>Whether this conception of the material universe is
adequate or not, it has undoubtedly exercised a very
important influence on scientific discovery as well as on
philosophical thought, and although it was never formulated
by Newton, and parts of it would probably have been
repudiated by him, there are indications that some such
ideas were in his head, and those who held the conception
most firmly undoubtedly derived their ideas directly or
indirectly from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p><a id="para_195"></a>195. Newton’s scientific method did not differ essentially
from that followed by Galilei (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_134">§&nbsp;134</a>), which
has been variously described as <b>complete induction</b> or
as the <b>inverse deductive method</b>, the difference in name
corresponding to a difference in the stress laid upon
different parts of the same general process. Facts are
obtained by observation or experiment; a hypothesis or
provisional theory is devised to account for them; from
this theory are obtained, if possible by a rigorous process
of deductive reasoning, certain consequences capable of
being compared with actual facts, and the comparison is
then made. In some cases the first process may appear
as the more important, but in Newton’s work the really
convincing part of the proof of his results lay in the
verification involved in the two last processes. This has
perhaps been somewhat obscured by his famous remark,
<i>Hypotheses non fingo</i> (I do not invent hypotheses), dissociated
from its context. The words occur in the conclusion of
the <i>Principia</i>, after he has been speaking of universal
gravitation:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have not yet been able to deduce (<i>deducere</i>) from
phenomena the reason of these properties of gravitation, and
I do not invent hypotheses. For any thing which cannot be
deduced from phenomena should be called a hypothesis.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Newton probably had in his mind such speculations as
the Cartesian vortices, which could not be deduced directly
from observations, and the consequences of which either
could not be worked out and compared with actual facts
or were inconsistent with them. Newton in fact rejected
hypotheses which were unverifiable, but he constantly made
hypotheses, suggested by observed facts, and verified by
the agreement of their consequences with fresh observed
facts. The extension of gravity to the moon (<a href="#para_173">§&nbsp;173</a>) is a
good example: he was acquainted with certain facts as to
the motion of falling bodies and the motion of the moon;
it occurred to him that the earth’s attraction might extend
as far as the moon, and certain other facts connected with
Kepler’s Third Law suggested the law of the inverse
square. If this were right, the moon’s acceleration towards
the earth ought to have a certain value, which could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
obtained by calculation. The calculation was made and
found to agree roughly with the actual motion of the
moon.</p>

<p>Moreover it may be fairly urged, in illustration of the
great importance of the process of verification, that
Newton’s fundamental laws were not rigorously established
by him, but that the deficiencies in his proofs have
been to a great extent filled up by the elaborate process
of verification that has gone on since. For the
motions of the solar system, as deduced by Newton from
gravitation and the laws of motion, only agreed roughly
with observation; many outstanding discrepancies were
left; and though there was a strong presumption that
these were due to the necessary imperfections of Newton’s
processes of calculation, an immense expenditure of labour
and ingenuity on the part of a series of mathematicians has
been required to remove these discrepancies one by one,
and as a matter of fact there remain even to-day a few
small ones which are unexplained (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_290">§&nbsp;290</a>).</p>

<small>OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY IN THE 18TH CENTURY.</small></h2>

<p>“Through Newton theory had made a great advance and was

<p><a id="para_196"></a>196. Newton virtually created a new department of
astronomy, <b>gravitational astronomy</b>, as it is often called,
and bequeathed to his successors the problem of deducing
more fully than he had succeeded in doing the motions of
the celestial bodies from their mutual gravitation.</p>

<p>To the solution of this problem Newton’s own countrymen
contributed next to nothing throughout the 18th
century, and his true successors were a group of Continental
mathematicians whose work began soon after his death,
though not till nearly half a century after the publication
of the <i>Principia</i>.</p>

<p>This failure of the British mathematicians to develop
Newton’s discoveries may be explained as due in part to
the absence or scarcity of men of real ability, but in part
also to the peculiarity of the mathematical form in which
Newton presented his discoveries. The <i>Principia</i> is written
almost entirely in the language of geometry, modified in
a special way to meet the requirements of the case; nearly
all subsequent progress in gravitational astronomy has
been made by mathematical methods known as <b>analysis</b>.
Although the distinction between the two methods cannot
be fully appreciated except by those who have used them
both, it may perhaps convey some impression of the differences
between them to say that in the geometrical treatment
of an astronomical problem each step of the reasoning is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
expressed in such a way as to be capable of being interpreted
in terms of the original problem, whereas in the
analytical treatment the problem is first expressed by
means of algebraical symbols; these symbols are manipulated
according to certain purely formal rules, no regard being
paid to the interpretation of the intermediate steps, and
the final algebraical result, if it can be obtained, yields on
interpretation the solution of the original problem. The
geometrical solution of a problem, if it can be obtained,
is frequently shorter, clearer, and more elegant; but, on
the other hand, each special problem has to be considered
separately, whereas the analytical solution can be conducted
to a great extent according to fixed rules applicable
in a larger number of cases. In Newton’s time modern
analysis was only just coming into being, some of the most
important parts of it being in fact the creation of Leibniz
and himself, and although he sometimes used analysis to
solve an astronomical problem, it was his practice to translate
the result into geometrical language before publication; in
doing so he was probably influenced to a large extent by
a personal preference for the elegance of geometrical proofs,
partly also by an unwillingness to increase the numerous
difficulties contained in the <i>Principia</i>, by using mathematical
methods which were comparatively unfamiliar. But though
in the hands of a master like Newton geometrical methods
were capable of producing astonishing results, the lesser
men who followed him were scarcely ever capable of using
his methods to obtain results beyond those which he
himself had reached. Excessive reverence for Newton and
all his ways, combined with the estrangement which long
subsisted between British and foreign mathematicians, as
the result of the fluxional controversy (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_191">§&nbsp;191</a>),
prevented the former from using the analytical methods
which were being rapidly perfected by Leibniz’s pupils and
other Continental mathematicians. Our mathematicians
remained, therefore, almost isolated during the whole of the
18th century, and with the exception of some admirable
work by <i>Colin Maclaurin</i> (1698-1746), which carried
Newton’s theory of the figure of the earth a stage further,
nothing of importance was done in our country for nearly
a century after Newton’s death to develop the theory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
gravitation beyond the point at which it was left in the
<i>Principia</i>.</p>

<p>In other departments of astronomy, however, important
progress was made both during and after Newton’s lifetime,
and by a curious inversion, while Newton’s ideas were
developed chiefly by French mathematicians, the Observatory
of Paris, at which Picard and others had done such
admirable work (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_160">§§&nbsp;160-2</a>), produced little of
real importance for nearly a century afterwards, and a large
part of the best observing work of the 18th century was
done by Newton’s countrymen. It will be convenient to
separate these two departments of astronomical work, and
to deal in the next chapter with the development of the
theory of gravitation.</p>

<p><a id="para_197"></a>197. The first of the great English observers was
Newton’s contemporary <i>John Flamsteed</i>, who was born near
Derby in 1646 and died at Greenwich in 1720.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Unfortunately
the character of his work was such that, marked
as it was by no brilliant discoveries, it is difficult to present
it in an attractive form or to give any adequate idea of
its real extent and importance. He was one of those
laborious and careful investigators, the results of whose
work are invaluable as material for subsequent research,
but are not striking in themselves.</p>

<p>He made some astronomical observations while quite a
boy, and wrote several papers, of a technical character, on
astronomical subjects, which attracted some attention. In
1675 appointed a member of a Committee to report
on a method for finding the longitude at sea which had
been offered to the Government by a certain Frenchman
of the name of <i>St. Pierre</i>. The Committee, acting largely
on Flamsteed’s advice, reported unfavourably on the
method in question, and memorialised Charles II. in
favour of founding a national observatory, in order that
better knowledge of the celestial bodies might lead to a
satisfactory method of finding the longitude, a problem
which the rapid increase of English shipping rendered of
great practical importance. The King having agreed,
Flamsteed was in the same year appointed to the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
office of Astronomer Royal, with a salary of £100 a year,
and the warrant for building an Observatory at Greenwich
was signed on June 12th, 1675. About a year was occupied
in building it, and Flamsteed took up his residence there
and began work in July 1676, five years after Cassini
entered upon his duties at the Observatory of Paris
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_160">§&nbsp;160</a>). The Greenwich Observatory was,
however, on a very different scale from the magnificent
sister institution. The King had, it is true, provided
Flamsteed with a building and a very small salary, but
furnished him neither with instruments nor with an assistant.
A few instruments he possessed already, a few more
were given to him by rich friends, and he gradually made
at his own expense some further instrumental additions of
importance. Some years after his appointment the Government
provided him with “a silly, surly labourer” to help
him with some of the rough work, but he was compelled
to provide more skilled assistance out of his own pocket,
and this necessity in turn compelled him to devote some
part of his valuable time to taking pupils.</p>

<p><a id="para_198"></a>198. Flamsteed’s great work was the construction of a
more accurate and more extensive star catalogue than any
that existed; he also made a number of observations of
the moon, of the sun, and to a less extent of other bodies.
Like Tycho, the author of the last great star catalogue
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, <a href="#para_107">§&nbsp;107</a>), he found problems continually presenting
themselves in the course of his work which had to be
solved before his main object could be accomplished, and
we accordingly owe to him the invention of several improvements
in practical astronomy, the best known being his
method of finding the position of the first point of Aries
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_42">§&nbsp;42</a>), one of the fundamental points with
reference to which all positions on the celestial sphere are
defined. He was the first astronomer to use a clock
systematically for the determination of one of the two
fundamental quantities (the right ascension) necessary to
fix the position of a star, a method which was first suggested
and to some extent used by Picard (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_157">§&nbsp;157</a>),
and, as soon as he could get the necessary instruments,
he regularly used the telescopic sights of Gascoigne and
Auzout (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_155">§&nbsp;155</a>), instead of making naked-eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
observations. Thus while Hevel (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_153">§&nbsp;153</a>)
was the last and most accurate observer of the old school,
employing methods not differing essentially from those
which had been in use for centuries, Flamsteed belongs
to the new school, and his methods differ rather in detail
than in principle from those now in vogue for similar work
at Greenwich, Paris, or Washington. This adoption of
new methods, together with the most scrupulous care in
details, rendered Flamsteed’s observations considerably
more accurate than any made in his time or earlier, the
first definite advance afterwards being made by Bradley
(<a href="#para_218">§&nbsp;218</a>).</p>

<p>Flamsteed compared favourably with many observers
by not merely taking and recording observations, but by
performing also the tedious process known as reduction
(<a href="#para_218">§&nbsp;218</a>), whereby the results of the observation are put
into a form suitable for use by other astronomers; this
process is usually performed in modern observatories by
assistants, but in Flamsteed’s case had to be done almost
exclusively by the astronomer himself. From this and
other causes he was extremely slow in publishing observations;
we have already alluded (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_192">§&nbsp;192</a>) to the
difficulty which Newton had in extracting lunar observations
from him, and after a time a feeling that the object for
which the Observatory had been founded was not being fulfilled
became pretty general among astronomers. Flamsteed
always suffered from bad health as well as from the
pecuniary and other difficulties which have been referred
to; moreover he was much more anxious that his observations
should be kept back till they were as accurate as
possible, than that they should be published in a less
perfect form and used for the researches which he once
called “Mr. Newton’s crotchets”; consequently he took
remonstrances about the delay in the publication of his
observations in bad part. Some painful quarrels occurred
between Flamsteed on the one hand and Newton and
Halley on the other. The last straw was the unauthorised
publication in 1712, under the editorship of Halley, of a
volume of Flamsteed’s observations, a proceeding to which
Flamsteed not unnaturally replied by calling Halley a
“malicious thief.” Three years later he succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
getting hold of all the unsold copies and in destroying
them, but fortunately he was also stimulated to prepare
for publication an authentic edition. The <i>Historia Coelestis
Britannica</i>, as he called the book, contained an immense
series of observations made both before and during his
career at Greenwich, but the most important and permanently
valuable part was a catalogue of the places of
nearly 3,000 stars.<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>Flamsteed himself only lived just long enough to finish
the second of the three volumes; the third was edited
by his assistants <i>Abraham Sharp</i> (1651-1742) and <i>Joseph
Crosthwait</i>; and the whole was published in 1725. Four
years later still appeared his valuable Star-Atlas, which
long remained in common use.</p>

<p>The catalogue was not only three times as extensive as
Tycho’s, which it virtually succeeded, but was also very
much more accurate. It has been estimated<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> that, whereas
Tycho’s determinations of the positions of the stars were
on the average about 1′ in error, the corresponding errors
in Flamsteed’s case were about 10″. This quantity is the
apparent diameter of a shilling seen from a distance of
about 500 yards; so that if two marks were made at
opposite points on the edge of the coin, and it were placed
at a distance of 500 yards, the two marks might be taken
to represent the true direction of an average star and its
direction as given in Flamsteed’s catalogue. In some
cases of course the error might be much greater and in
others considerably less.</p>

<p>Flamsteed contributed to astronomy no ideas of first-rate
importance; he had not the ingenuity of Picard and of
Roemer in devising instrumental improvements, and he
took little interest in the theoretical work of Newton;<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
but by unflagging industry and scrupulous care he succeeded
in bequeathing to his successors an immense treasure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
observations, executed with all the accuracy that his instrumental
means permitted.</p>

<p><a id="para_199"></a>199. Flamsteed was succeeded as Astronomer Royal
by Edmund Halley, whom we have already met with
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_176">§&nbsp;176</a>) as Newton’s friend and helper.</p>

<p>Born in 1656, ten years after Flamsteed, he studied
astronomy in his schooldays, and published a paper on the
orbits of the planets as early as 1676. In the same year
he set off for St. Helena (in latitude 16° S.) in order to
make observations of stars which were too near the south
pole to be visible in Europe. The climate turned out to
be disappointing, and he was only able after his return
to publish (1678) a catalogue of the places of 341 southern
stars, which constituted, however, an important addition
to precise knowledge of the stars. The catalogue was also
remarkable as being the first based on telescopic observation,
though the observations do not seem to have been
taken with all the accuracy which his instruments rendered
attainable. During his stay at St. Helena he also took
a number of pendulum observations which confirmed the
results obtained a few years before by Richer at Cayenne
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>), and also observed a transit of Mercury
across the sun, which occurred in November 1677.</p>

<p>After his return to England he took an active part in
current scientific questions, particularly in those connected
with astronomy, and made several small contributions to
the subject. In 1684, as we have seen, he first came
effectively into contact with Newton, and spent a good
part of the next few years in helping him with the
<i>Principia</i>.</p>

<p><a id="para_200"></a>200. Of his numerous contributions to astronomy, which
touched almost every branch of the subject, his work
on comets is the best known and probably the most
important. He observed the comets of 1680 and 1682;
he worked out the paths both of these and of a number
of other recorded comets in accordance with Newton’s
principles, and contributed a good deal of the material
contained in the sections of the <i>Principia</i> dealing with
comets, particularly in the later editions. In 1705 he
published a <i>Synopsis of Cometary Astronomy</i> in which no
less than 24 cometary orbits were calculated. Struck by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
the resemblance between the paths described by the
comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, and by the approximate
equality in the intervals between their respective appearances
and that of a fourth comet seen in 1456, he was
shrewd enough to conjecture that the three later comets,
if not all four, were really different appearances of the same
comet, which revolved round the sun in an elongated
ellipse in a period of about 75 or 76 years. He explained
the difference between the 76 years which separate the
appearances of the comet in 1531 and 1607, and the slightly
shorter period which elapsed between 1607 and 1682, as
probably due to the perturbations caused by planets near
which the comet had passed; and finally predicted the
probable reappearance of the same comet (which now
deservedly bears his name) about 76 years after its last
appearance, <i>i.e.</i> about 1758, though he was again aware
that planetary perturbation might alter the time of its
appearance; and the actual appearance of the comet about
the predicted time (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_231">§&nbsp;231</a>) marked an important
era in the progress of our knowledge of these extremely
troublesome and erratic bodies.</p>

<p><a id="para_201"></a>201. In 1693 Halley read before the Royal Society a
paper in which he called attention to the difficulty of
reconciling certain ancient eclipses with the known motion
of the moon, and referred to the possibility of some slight
increase in the moon’s average rate of motion round the
earth.</p>

<p>This irregularity, now known as the <b>secular acceleration
of the moon’s mean motion</b>, was subsequently more
definitely established as a fact of observation; and the
difficulties met with in explaining it as a result of gravitation
have rendered it one of the most interesting of the
moon’s numerous irregularities (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_240">§&nbsp;240</a>, and
chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_287">§&nbsp;287</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_202"></a>202. Halley also rendered good service to astronomy
by calling attention to the importance of the expected
transits of Venus across the sun in 1761 and 1769 as a
means of ascertaining the distance of the sun. The
method had been suggested rather vaguely by Kepler, and
more definitely by James Gregory in his <i>Optics</i> published
in 1663. The idea was first suggested to Halley by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
his observation of the transit of Mercury in 1677. In
three papers published by the Royal Society he spoke
warmly of the advantages of the method, and discussed
in some detail the places and means most suitable for
observing the transit of 1761. He pointed out that the
desired result could be deduced from a comparison of
the durations of the transit of Venus, as seen from different
stations on the earth, <i>i.e.</i> of the intervals between the first
appearance of Venus on the sun’s disc and the final disappearance,
as seen at two or more different stations. He
estimated, moreover, that this interval of time, which would
be several hours in length, could be measured with an
error of only about two seconds, and that in consequence
the method might be relied upon to give the distance of
the sun to within about 1∕500 part of its true value. As the
current estimates of the sun’s distance differed among one
another by 20 or 30 per cent., the new method, expounded
with Halley’s customary lucidity and enthusiasm, not unnaturally
stimulated astronomers to take great trouble to
carry out Halley’s recommendations. The results, as we
shall see (<a href="#para_227">§&nbsp;227</a>), were, however, by no means equal to
Halley’s expectations.</p>

<p><a id="para_203"></a>203. In 1718 Halley called attention to the fact that
three well-known stars, Sirius, Procyon, and Arcturus, had
changed their angular distances from the ecliptic since
Greek times, and that Sirius had even changed its position
perceptibly since the time of Tycho Brahe. Moreover
comparison of the places of other stars shewed that the
changes could not satisfactorily be attributed to any motion
of the ecliptic, and although he was well aware that the
possible errors of observation were such as to introduce
a considerable uncertainty into the amounts involved, he
felt sure that such errors could not wholly account for
the discrepancies noticed, but that the stars in question
must have really shifted their positions in relation to the
rest; and he naturally inferred that it would be possible
to detect similar <b>proper motions</b> (as they are now called) in
other so-called “fixed” stars.</p>

<p><a id="para_204"></a>204. He also devoted a good deal of time to the standing
astronomical problem of improving the tables of the
moon and planets, particularly the former. He made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
observations of the moon as early as 1683, and by means
of them effected some improvement in the tables. In
1676 he had already noted defects in the existing tables
of Jupiter and Saturn, and ultimately satisfied himself of
the existence of certain irregularities in the motion of these
two planets, suspected long ago by Horrocks (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>,
<a href="#para_156">§&nbsp;156</a>); these irregularities he attributed correctly to the
perturbations of the two planets by one another, though
he was not mathematician enough to work out the theory;
from observation, however, he was able to estimate the
irregularities in question with fair accuracy and to improve
the planetary tables by making allowance for them. But
neither the lunar nor the planetary tables were ever completed
in a form which Halley thought satisfactory. By
1719 they were printed, but kept back from publication,
in hopes that subsequent improvements might be effected.
After his appointment as Astronomer Royal in succession
to Flamsteed (1720) he devoted special attention to getting
fresh observations for this purpose, but he found the
Observatory almost bare of instruments, those used by
Flamsteed having been his private property, and having
been removed as such by his heirs or creditors. Although
Halley procured some instruments, and made with them
a number of observations, chiefly of the moon, the age (63)
at which he entered upon his office prevented him from
initiating much, or from carrying out his duties with great
energy, and the observations taken were in consequence
only of secondary importance, while the tables for the
improvement of which they were specially designed were
only finally published in 1752, ten years after the death
of their author. Although they thus appeared many years
after the time at which they were virtually prepared and
owed little to the progress of science during the interval,
they at once became and for some time remained the
standard tables for both the lunar and planetary motions
(cf. §&nbsp;226, and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_247">§&nbsp;247</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_205"></a>205. Halley’s remarkable versatility in scientific work is
further illustrated by the labour which he expended in
editing the writings of the great Greek geometer Apollonius
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_38">§&nbsp;38</a>) and the star catalogue of Ptolemy
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_50">§&nbsp;50</a>). He was also one of the first of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
astronomers to pay careful attention to the effects to be
observed during a total eclipse of the sun, and in the
vivid description which he wrote of the eclipse of 1715,
besides referring to the mysterious corona, which Kepler
and others had noticed before (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_145">§&nbsp;145</a>), he
called attention also to “a very narrow streak of a dusky
but strong Red Light,” which was evidently a portion of
that remarkable envelope of the sun which has been so
extensively studied in modern times (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_301">§&nbsp;301</a>)
under the name of the chromosphere.</p>

<p>It is worth while to notice, as an illustration of Halley’s
unselfish enthusiasm for science and of his power of looking
to the future, that two of his most important pieces of work,
by which certainly he is now best known, necessarily
appeared during his lifetime as of little value, and only
bore their fruit after his death (1742), for his comet only
returned in 1759, when he had been dead 17 years, and
the first of the pair of transits of Venus, from which he
had shewn how to deduce the distance of the sun, took
place two years later still (<a href="#para_227">§&nbsp;227</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_206"></a>206. The third Astronomer Royal, <i>James Bradley</i>, is
popularly known as the author of two memorable discoveries,
<i>viz.</i> the aberration of light and the nutation
of the earth’s axis. Remarkable as these are both in
themselves and on account of the ingenious and subtle
reasoning and minutely accurate observations by means of
which they were made, they were in fact incidents in a long
and active astronomical career, which resulted in the
execution of a vast mass of work of great value.</p>

<p>The external events of Bradley’s life may be dealt with
very briefly. Born in 1693, he proceeded in due course
to Oxford (B.A. 1714, M.A. 1717), but acquired his first
knowledge of astronomy and his marked taste for the
subject from his uncle <i>James Pound</i>, for many years rector
of Wansted in Essex, who was one of the best observers of
the time. Bradley lived with his uncle for some years after
leaving Oxford, and carried out a number of observations
in concert with him. The first recorded observation of
Bradley’s is dated 1715, and by 1718 he was sufficiently
well thought of in the scientific world to receive the honour
of election as a Fellow of the Royal Society. But, as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
biographer<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> remarks, “it could not be foreseen that his
astronomical labours would lead to any establishment in
life, and it became necessary for him to embrace a profession.”
He accordingly took orders, and was fortunate
enough to be presented almost at once to two livings, the
duties attached to which do not seem to have interfered
appreciably with the prosecution of his astronomical studies
at Wansted.</p>

<p>In 1721 he was appointed Savilian Professor of Astronomy
at Oxford, and resigned his livings. The work of the
professorship appears to have been very light, and for more
than ten years he continued to reside chiefly at Wansted,
even after his uncle’s death in 1724. In 1732 he took a
house in Oxford and set up there most of his instruments,
leaving, however, at Wansted the most important of all,
the “zenith-sector,” with which his two famous discoveries
were made. Ten years afterwards Halley’s death rendered
the post of Astronomer Royal vacant, and Bradley received
the appointment.</p>

<p>The work of the Observatory had been a good deal
neglected by Halley during the last few years of his life,
and Bradley’s first care was to effect necessary repairs in
the instruments. Although the equipment of the Observatory
with instruments worthy of its position and of the
state of science at the time was a work of years, Bradley
had some of the most important instruments in good
working order within a few months of his appointment,
and observations were henceforward made systematically.
Although the 20 remaining years of his life (1742-1762)
were chiefly spent at Greenwich in the discharge of the
duties of his office and in researches connected with them,
he retained his professorship at Oxford, and continued to
make observations at Wansted at least up till 1747.</p>

<p><a id="para_207"></a>207. The discovery of aberration resulted from an attempt
to detect the parallactic displacement of stars which should
result from the annual motion of the earth. Ever since
the Coppernican controversy had called attention to the
importance of the problem (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_92">§&nbsp;92</a> and
chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_129">§&nbsp;129</a>), it had naturally exerted a fascination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
on the minds of observing astronomers, many of whom had
tried to detect the motion in question, and some of whom
(including the “universal claimant” Hooke) professed to
have succeeded. Actually, however, all previous attempts
had been failures, and Bradley was no more successful than
his predecessors in this particular undertaking, but was
able to deduce from his observations two results of great
interest and of an entirely unexpected character.</p>

<p>The problem which Bradley set himself was to examine
whether any star could be seen to have in the course of the
year a slight motion relative to others or relative to fixed
points on the celestial sphere such as the pole. It was
known that such a motion, if it existed, must be very
small, and it was therefore evident that extreme delicacy
in instrumental adjustments and the greatest care in observation
would have to be employed. Bradley worked at first
in conjunction with his friend <i>Samuel Molyneux</i> (1689-1728),
who had erected a telescope at Kew. In accordance with the
method adopted in a similar investigation by Hooke, whose
results it was desired to test, the telescope was fixed in a
nearly vertical position, so chosen that a particular star in
the Dragon (γ Draconis) would be visible through it when
it crossed the meridian, and the telescope was mounted
with great care so as to maintain an invariable position
throughout the year. If then the star in question were to
undergo any motion which altered its distance from the
pole, there would be a corresponding alteration in the position
in which it would be seen in the field of view of
the telescope. The first observations were taken on
December 14th, 1725 (N.S.), and by December 28th
Bradley believed that he had already noticed a slight displacement
of the star towards the south. This motion
was clearly verified on January 1st, and was then observed
to continue; in the following March the star reached its
extreme southern position, and then began to move northwards
again. In September it once more altered its
direction of motion, and by the end of the year had
completed the cycle of its changes and returned to its
original position, the greatest change in position amounting
to nearly 40′.</p>

<p>The star was thus observed to go through <i>some</i> annual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
motion. It was, however, at once evident to Bradley that
this motion was not the parallactic motion of which he
was in search, for the position of the star was such that
parallax would have made it appear farthest south in
December and farthest north in June, or in each case three
months earlier than was the case in the actual observations.
Another explanation which suggested itself was that the
earth’s axis might have a to-and-fro oscillatory motion or
nutation which would alter the position of the celestial pole
and hence produce a corresponding alteration in the position
of the star. Such a motion of the celestial pole would
evidently produce opposite effects on two stars situated on
opposite sides of it, as any motion which brought the pole
nearer to one star of such a pair would necessarily move
it away from the other. Within a fortnight of the decisive
observation made on January 1st a star<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> had already been
selected for the application of this test, with the result which
can best be given in Bradley’s own words:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A nutation of the earth’s axis was one of the first things that
offered itself upon this occasion, but it was soon found to be
insufficient; for though it might have accounted for the change
of declination in γ Draconis, yet it would not at the same time
agree with the phaenomena in other stars; particularly in a small
one almost opposite in right ascension to γ Draconis, at about
the same distance from the north pole of the equator: for though
this star seemed to move the same way as a nutation of the
earth’s axis would have made it, yet, it changing its declination
but about half as much as γ Draconis in the same time, (as
appeared upon comparing the observations of both made upon
the same days, at different seasons of the year,) this plainly
proved that the apparent motion of the stars was not occasioned
by a real nutation, since, if that had been the cause, the alteration
in both stars would have been near equal.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One or two other explanations were tested and found
insufficient, and as the result of a series of observations
extending over about two years, the phenomenon in question,
although amply established, still remained quite
unexplained.</p>

<p>By this time Bradley had mounted an instrument of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
own at Wansted, so arranged that it was possible to observe
through it the motions of stars other than γ Draconis.</p>

<p>Several stars were watched carefully throughout a year,
and the observations thus obtained gave Bradley a fairly
complete knowledge of the geometrical laws according to
which the motions varied both from star to star and in
the course of the year.</p>

<p><a id="para_208"></a>208. The true explanation of <b>aberration</b>, as the phenomenon
in question was afterwards called, appears to have
occurred to him about September, 1728, and was published
to the Royal Society, after some further verification, early
in the following year. According to a well-known story,<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
he noticed, while sailing on the Thames, that a vane on
the masthead appeared to change its direction every time
that the boat altered its course, and was informed by the
sailors that this change was not due to any alteration in
the wind’s direction, but to that of the boat’s course. In
fact the apparent direction of the wind, as shewn by the
vane, was not the true direction of the wind, but resulted
from a combination of the motions of the wind and of the
boat, being more precisely that of the motion of the wind
<i>relative</i> to the boat. Replacing in imagination the wind
by light coming from a star, and the boat shifting its
course by the earth moving round the sun and continually
changing its direction of motion, Bradley arrived at an
explanation which, when worked out in detail, was found
to account most satisfactorily for the apparent changes in
the direction of a star which he had been studying. His
own account of the matter is as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At last I conjectured that all the phaenomena hitherto mentioned
proceeded from the progressive motion of light and the
earth’s annual motion in its orbit. For I perceived that, if light
was propagated in time, the apparent place of a fixed object
would not be the same when the eye is at rest, as when it is
moving in any other direction than that of the line passing
through the eye and object; and that when the eye is moving</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>in different directions, the apparent place of the object would be
different.</p>

<p>“I considered this matter in the following manner. I imagined
<span class="smcap lowercase">C A</span> to be a ray of light, falling perpendicularly upon the line
<span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span>; then if the eye is at rest at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, the object must appear in
the direction <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span>, whether light be propagated in time or in an
instant. But if the eye is moving from <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> towards <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, and light
is propagated in time, with a velocity that is to the velocity of
the eye, as <span class="smcap lowercase">C A</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">B A</span>; then light moving from <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, whilst
the eye moves from <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, that particle of it by which the object
will be discerned when the eye in its
motion comes to <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, is at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> when the eye
is at <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. Joining the points <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, I supposed
the line <span class="smcap lowercase">C B</span> to be a tube (inclined
to the line <span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span> in the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">D B C</span>) of such
a diameter as to admit of but one particle
of light; then it was easy to conceive that
the particle of light at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> (by which the
object must be seen when the eye, as it
moves along, arrives at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>) would pass
through the tube <span class="smcap lowercase">B C</span>, if it is inclined to
<span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span> in the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">D B C</span>, and accompanies
the eye in its motion from <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>; and
that it could not come to the eye, placed
behind such a tube, if it had any other
inclination to the line <span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span>....</p>

Bradley’s paper in
the <i>Phil. Trans.</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>
<p>“Although therefore the true or real
place of an object is perpendicular to the
line in which the eye is moving, yet the
visible place will not be so, since that,
no doubt, must be in the direction of the
tube; but the difference between the true
and apparent place will be (caeteris paribus)
greater or less, according to the
different proportion between the velocity
of light and that of the eye. So that if
we could suppose that light was propagated
in an instant, then there would be no difference between
the real and visible place of an object, although the eye were
in motion; for in that case, <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span> being infinite with respect
to <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A C B</span> (the difference between the true and
visible place) vanishes. But if light be propagated in time,
(which I presume will readily be allowed by most of the
philosophers of this age,) then it is evident from the foregoing
considerations, that there will be always a difference between
the real and visible place of an object, unless the eye is moving
either directly towards or from the object.”</p>

<p>Bradley’s explanation shews that the apparent position of
a star is determined by the motion of the star’s light <i>relative</i>
to the earth, so that the star appears slightly nearer to the
point on the celestial sphere towards which the earth is
moving than would otherwise be the case. A familiar
illustration of a precisely analogous effect may perhaps be
of service. Any one walking on a rainy but windless day
protects himself most effectually by holding his umbrella,
not immediately over his head, but a little in front, exactly
as he would do if he were at rest and there were a slight
wind blowing in his face. In fact, if he were to ignore
his own motion and pay attention only to the direction in
which he found it advisable to point his umbrella, he would
believe that there was a slight head-wind blowing the rain
towards him.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<a id="Fig_75"></a>
<img src="images/i_p263.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>—The aberration
of light.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_209"></a>209. The passage quoted from Bradley’s paper deals
only with the simple case in which the star is at right angles
to the direction of the earth’s motion. He
shews elsewhere that if the star is in any
other direction the effect is of the same kind
but less in amount. In Bradley’s figure
(fig. 74) the amount of the star’s displacement
from its true position is represented by
the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">B C A</span>, which depends on the proportion
between the lines <span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>; but
if (as in fig. 75) the earth is moving (without
change of speed) in the direction <span class="smcap lowercase">A B′</span> instead
of <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, so that the direction of the star is
oblique to it, it is evident from the figure
that the star’s displacement, represented by
the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A C B′</span>, is less than before; and
the amount varies according to a simple
mathematical law<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> with the angle between
the two directions. It follows therefore
that the displacement in question is different
for different stars, as Bradley’s observations
had already shewn, and is, moreover, different
for the same star in the course of the
year, so that a star appears to describe a
curve which is very nearly an ellipse (fig. 76), the centre (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
corresponding to the position which the star would occupy
if aberration did not exist. It is not difficult to see that,
wherever a star is situated, the earth’s motion is twice a
year, at intervals of six months, at right angles to the direction
of the star, and that at these times the star receives the
greatest possible displacement from its mean position, and
is consequently at the ends of the greatest axis of the
ellipse which it describes, as at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">A′</span>, whereas at intermediate
times it
undergoes its least
displacement, as at
<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B′</span>. The
greatest displacement
<span class="smcap lowercase">S A</span>, or half of
<span class="smcap lowercase">A A′</span>, which is the
same for all stars,
is known as the <b>constant
of aberration</b>,
and was fixed by
Bradley at between
20″ and 20-1∕2″, the
value at present accepted being 20″·47. The least displacement,
on the other hand, <span class="smcap lowercase">S B</span>, or half of <span class="smcap lowercase">B B′</span>, was shewn
to depend in a simple way upon the star’s distance from
the ecliptic, being greatest for stars farthest from the
ecliptic.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<a id="Fig_76"></a>
<img src="images/i_p264.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>—The aberrational ellipse.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_210"></a>210. The constant of aberration, which is represented by
the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">A C B</span> in fig. 74, depends only on the ratio between
<span class="smcap lowercase">A C</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, which are in turn proportional to the velocities
of light and of the earth. Observations of aberration give
then the ratio of these two velocities. From Bradley’s
value of the constant of aberration it follows by an easy
calculation that the velocity of light is about 10,000 times
that of the earth; Bradley also put this result into the form
that light travels from the sun to the earth in 8 minutes 13
seconds. From observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s
moons, Roemer and others had estimated the same interval
at from 8 to 11 minutes (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_162">§&nbsp;162</a>); and Bradley
was thus able to get a satisfactory confirmation of the truth
of his discovery. Aberration being once established, the
same calculation could be used to give the most accurate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
measure of the velocity of light in terms of the dimensions
of the earth’s orbit, the determination of aberration being
susceptible of considerably greater accuracy than the
corresponding measurements required for Roemer’s method.</p>

<p><a id="para_211"></a>211. One difficulty in the theory of aberration deserves
mention. Bradley’s own explanation, quoted above, refers
to light as a material substance shot out from the star or
other luminous body. This was in accordance with the
corpuscular theory of light, which was supported by the
great weight of Newton’s authority and was commonly
accepted in the 18th century. Modern physicists, however,
have entirely abandoned the corpuscular theory, and regard
light as a particular form of wave-motion transmitted
through ether. From this point of view Bradley’s explanation
and the physical illustrations given are far less
convincing; the question becomes in fact one of considerable
difficulty, and the most careful and elaborate of modern
investigations cannot be said to be altogether satisfactory.
The curious inference may be drawn that, if the more
correct modern notions of the nature of light had prevailed
in Bradley’s time, it must have been very much more
difficult, if not impracticable, for him to have thought of his
explanation of the stellar motions which he was studying;
and thus an erroneous theory led to a most important
discovery.</p>

<p><a id="para_212"></a>212. Bradley had of course not forgotten the original
object of his investigation. He satisfied himself, however,
that the agreement between the observed positions of γ Draconis
and those which resulted from aberration was so
close that any displacement of a star due to parallax which
might exist must certainly be less than 2″, and probably
not more than 1∕2″, so that the large parallax amounting to
nearly 30″, which Hooke claimed to have detected, must
certainly be rejected as erroneous.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the Coppernican controversy,
however, Bradley’s discovery was almost as good as the
discovery of a parallax; since if the earth were at rest
no explanation of the least plausibility could be given of
aberration.</p>

<p><a id="para_213"></a>213. The close agreement thus obtained between theory
and observation would have satisfied an astronomer less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
accurate and careful than Bradley. But in his paper on
aberration (1729) we find him writing:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have likewise met with some small varieties in the declination
of other stars in different years which do not seem to
proceed from the same cause.... But whether these small
alterations proceed from a regular cause, or are occasioned by
any change in the materials, etc., of my instrument, I am not yet
able fully to determine.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The slender clue thus obtained was carefully followed
up and led to a second striking discovery, which affords
one of the most beautiful illustrations of the important
results which can be deduced from the study of “residual
phenomena.” Aberration causes a star to go through a
cyclical series of changes in the course of a year; if therefore
at the end of a year a star is found not to have
returned to its original place, some other explanation of
the motion has to be sought. Precession was one known
cause of such an alteration; but Bradley found, at the end
of his first year’s set of observations at Wansted, that the
alterations in the positions of various stars differed by a
minute amount (not exceeding 2″) from those which would
have resulted from the usual estimate of precession; and
that, although an alteration in the value of precession would
account for the observed motions of some of these stars,
it would have increased the discrepancy in the case of
others. A nutation or nodding of the earth’s axis had,
as we have seen (<a href="#para_207">§&nbsp;207</a>), already presented itself to him
as a possibility; and although it had been shewn to be
incapable of accounting for the main phenomenon—due to
aberration—it might prove to be a satisfactory explanation
of the much smaller residual motions. It soon occurred
to Bradley that such a nutation might be due to the action
of the moon, as both observation and the Newtonian
explanation of precession indicated:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I suspected that the moon’s action upon the equatorial parts
of the earth might produce these effects: for if the precession
of the equinox be, according to Sir Isaac Newton’s principles,
caused by the actions of the sun and moon upon those parts,
the plane of the moon’s orbit being at one time above ten
degrees more inclined to the plane of the equator than at
another, it was reasonable to conclude, that the part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
whole annual precession, which arises from her action, would
in different years be varied in its quantity; whereas the plane
of the ecliptic, wherein the sun appears, keeping always nearly
the same inclination to the equator, that part of the precession
which is owing to the sun’s action may be the same every year;
and from hence it would follow, that although the mean annual
precession, proceeding from the joint actions of the sun and
moon, were 50″, yet the apparent annual precession might
sometimes exceed and sometimes fall short of that mean
quantity, according to the various situations of the nodes of
the moon’s orbit.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Newton in his discussion of precession (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, §&nbsp;188;
<i>Principia</i>, Book III., proposition 21) had pointed out
the existence of a small irregularity with a period of six
months. But it is evident, on looking at this discussion
of the effect of the solar and lunar attractions on the
protuberant parts of the earth, that the various alterations
in the positions of the sun and moon relative to the earth
might be expected to produce irregularities, and that the
uniform precessional motion known from observation and
deduced from gravitation by Newton was, as it were, only
a smoothing out of a motion of a much more complicated
character. Except for the allusion referred to, Newton
made no attempt to discuss these irregularities, and none
of them had as yet been detected by observation.</p>

<p>Of the numerous irregularities of this class which are now
known, and which may be referred to generally as <b>nutation</b>,
that indicated by Bradley in the passage just quoted is
by far the most important. As soon as the idea of an
irregularity depending on the position of the moon’s nodes
occurred to him, he saw that it would be desirable to watch
the motions of several stars during the whole period (about
19 years) occupied by the moon’s nodes in performing the
circuit of the ecliptic and returning to the same position.
This inquiry was successfully carried out between 1727 and
1747 with the telescope mounted at Wansted. When the
moon’s nodes had performed half their revolution, <i>i.e.</i>
after about nine years, the correspondence between the
displacements of the stars and the changes in the moon’s
orbit was so close that Bradley was satisfied with the general
correctness of his theory, and in 1737 he communicated the
result privately to Maupertuis (<a href="#para_221">§&nbsp;221</a>), with whom he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
had some scientific correspondence. Maupertuis appears
to have told others, but Bradley himself waited patiently
for the completion of the period which he regarded as
necessary for the satisfactory verification of his theory, and
only published his results definitely at the beginning of
1748.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>—Precession and nutation.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_214"></a>214. Bradley’s observations established the existence of
certain alterations in the positions of various stars, which
could be accounted for by supposing that, on the one
hand, the distance of the pole from the ecliptic fluctuated,
and that, on the other, the precessional motion of
the pole was not uniform, but varied slightly in speed.
<i>John Machin</i> (?-1751), one of the best English mathematicians
of the time, pointed out that these effects would
be produced if the pole were supposed to describe on the
celestial sphere a minute circle in a period of rather less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
than 19 years—being that of the revolution of the nodes
of the moon’s orbit—round the position which it would
occupy if there were no nutation, but a uniform precession.
Bradley found that this hypothesis fitted his observations,
but that it would be better to replace the circle by a
slightly flattened ellipse, the greatest and least axes of which
he estimated at about 18″ and 16″ respectively.<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> This
ellipse would be about as large as a shilling placed in a
slightly oblique position at a distance of 300 yards from
the eye. The motion of the pole was thus shewn to be
a double one; as the result of precession and nutation
combined it describes round the pole of the ecliptic “a
gently undulated ring,” as represented in the figure, in
which, however, the undulations due to nutation are
enormously exaggerated.</p>

<p><a id="para_215"></a>215. Although Bradley was aware that nutation must
be produced by the action of the moon, he left the
theoretical investigation of its cause to more skilled
mathematicians than himself.</p>

<p>In the following year (1749) the French mathematician
D’Alembert (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_232">§&nbsp;232</a>) published a treatise<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> in
which not only precession, but also a motion of nutation
agreeing closely with that observed by Bradley, were shewn
by a rigorous process of analysis to be due to the attraction
of the moon on the protuberant parts of the earth round
the equator (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_187">§&nbsp;187</a>), while Newton’s explanation
of precession was confirmed by the same piece
of work. Euler (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_236">§&nbsp;236</a>) published soon afterwards
another investigation of the same subject; and it
has been studied afresh by many mathematical astronomers
since that time, with the result that Bradley’s nutation
is found to be only the most important of a long series
of minute irregularities in the motion of the earth’s axis.</p>

<p><a id="para_216"></a>216. Although aberration and nutation have been discussed
first, as being the most important of Bradle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>y’s
discoveries, other investigations were carried out by him
before or during the same time.</p>

<p>The earliest important piece of work which he accomplished
was in connection with Jupiter’s satellites. His
uncle had devoted a good deal of attention to this subject,
and had drawn up some tables dealing with the motion of
the first satellite, which were based on those of Domenico
Cassini, but contained a good many improvements. Bradley
seems for some years to have made a practice of frequently
observing the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites, and of noting
discrepancies between the observations and the tables; and
he was thus able to detect several hitherto unnoticed
peculiarities in the motions, and thereby to form improved
tables. The most interesting discovery was that of a
period of 437 days, after which the motions of the three
inner satellites recurred with the same irregularities.
Bradley, like Pound, made use of Roemer’s suggestion
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_162">§&nbsp;162</a>) that light occupied a finite time in
travelling from Jupiter to the earth, a theory which Cassini
and his school long rejected. Bradley’s tables of Jupiter’s
satellites were embodied in Halley’s planetary and lunar
tables, printed in 1719, but not published till more than
30 years afterwards (<a href="#para_204">§&nbsp;204</a>). Before that date the Swedish
astronomer <i>Pehr Vilhelm Wargentin</i> (1717-1783) had independently
discovered the period of 437 days, which he
utilised for the construction of an extremely accurate set
of tables for the satellites published in 1746.</p>

<p>In this case as in that of nutation Bradley knew that his
mathematical powers were unequal to giving an explanation
on gravitational principles of the inequalities which observation
had revealed to him, though he was well aware of the
importance of such an undertaking, and definitely expressed
the hope “that some geometer,<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> in imitation of the great
Newton, would apply himself to the investigation of these
irregularities, from the certain and demonstrative principles
of gravity.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, he made in 1726 an interesting
practical application of his superior knowledge of Jupite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>r’s
satellites by determining, in accordance with Galilei’s
method (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_127">§&nbsp;127</a>), but with remarkable accuracy,
the longitudes of Lisbon and of New York.</p>

<p><a id="para_217"></a>217. Among Bradley’s minor pieces of work may be
mentioned his observations of several comets and his
calculation of their respective orbits according to Newton’s
method; the construction of improved tables of refraction,
which remained in use for nearly a century; a share in
pendulum experiments carried out in England and Jamaica
with the object of verifying the variation of gravity in
different latitudes; a careful testing of Mayer’s lunar tables
(<a href="#para_226">§&nbsp;226</a>), together with improvements of them; and lastly,
some work in connection with the reform of the calendar
made in 1752 (cf, chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_22">§&nbsp;22</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_218"></a>218. It remains to give some account of the magnificent
series of observations carried out during Bradley’s administration
of the Greenwich Observatory.</p>

<p>These observations fall into two chief divisions of unequal
merit, those after 1749 having been made with some more
accurate instruments which a grant from the government
enabled him at that time to procure.</p>

<p>The main work of the Observatory under Bradley consisted
in taking observations of fixed stars, and to a lesser
extent of other bodies, as they passed the meridian, the
instruments used (the “mural quadrant” and the “transit
instrument”) being capable of motion only in the meridian,
and being therefore steadier and susceptible of greater
accuracy than those with more freedom of movement.
The most important observations taken during the years
1750-1762, amounting to about 60,000, were published long
after Bradley’s death in two large volumes which appeared
in 1798 and 1805. A selection of them had been used
earlier as the basis of a small star catalogue, published in
the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> for 1773; but it was not till 1818
that the publication of Bessel’s <i>Fundamenta Astronomiae</i>
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_277">§&nbsp;277</a>), a catalogue of more than 3000 stars
based on Bradley’s observations, rendered these observations
thoroughly available for astronomical work. One reason
for this apparently excessive delay is to be found in
Bradley’s way of working. Allusion has already been
made to a variety of causes which prevent the apparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
place of a star, as seen in the telescope and noted at the
time, from being a satisfactory permanent record of its
position. There are various instrumental errors, and errors
due to refraction; again, if a star’s places at two different
times are to be compared, precession must be taken into
account; and Bradley himself unravelled in aberration and
nutation two fresh sources of error. In order therefore
to put into a form satisfactory for permanent reference a
number of star observations, it is necessary to make corrections
which have the effect of allowing for these various
sources of error. This process of <b>reduction</b>, as it is technically
called, involves a certain amount of rather tedious
calculation, and though in modern observatories the process
has been so far systematised that it can be carried out
almost according to fixed rules by comparatively unskilled
assistants, in Bradley’s time it required more judgment,
and it is doubtful if his assistants could have performed
the work satisfactorily, even if their time had not been fully
occupied with other duties. Bradley himself probably
found the necessary calculations tedious, and preferred
devoting his energies to work of a higher order. It is
true that Delambre, the famous French historian of
astronomy, assures his readers that he had never found
the reduction of an observation tedious if performed the
same day, but a glance at any of his books is enough to
shew his extraordinary fondness for long calculations of
a fairly elementary character, and assuredly Bradley is not
the only astronomer whose tastes have in this respect
differed fundamentally from Delambre’s. Moreover reducing
an observation is generally found to be a duty that, like
answering letters, grows harder to perform the longer it
is neglected; and it is not only less interesting but also
much more difficult for an astronomer to deal satisfactorily
with some one else’s observations than with his own. It
is not therefore surprising that after Bradley’s death a
long interval should have elapsed before an astronomer
appeared with both the skill and the patience necessary
for the complete reduction of Bradley’s 60,000 observations.</p>

<p>A variety of circumstances combined to make Bradley’s
observations decidedly superior to those of his predecessors.
He evidently possessed in a marked degree the personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
characteristics—of eye and judgment—which make a first-rate
observer; his instruments were mounted in the best
known way for securing accuracy, and were constructed by
the most skilful makers; he made a point of studying very
carefully the defects of his instruments, and of allowing
for them; his discoveries of aberration and nutation
enabled him to avoid sources of error, amounting to a
considerable number of seconds, which his predecessors
could only have escaped imperfectly by taking the average
of a number of observations; and his improved tables of
refraction still further added to the correctness of his
results.</p>

<p>Bessel estimates that the errors in Bradley’s observations
of the declination of stars were usually less than 4″, while
the corresponding errors in right ascension, a quantity which
depends ultimately on a time-observation, were less than 15″,
or one second of time. His observations thus shewed a
considerable advance in accuracy compared with those of
Flamsteed (<a href="#para_198">§&nbsp;198</a>), which represented the best that had
hitherto been done.</p>

<p><a id="para_219"></a>219. The next Astronomer Royal was <i>Nathaniel Bliss</i>
(1700-1764), who died after two years. He was in turn
succeeded by <i>Nevil Maskelyne</i> (1732-1811), who carried
on for nearly half a century the tradition of accurate
observation which Bradley had established at Greenwich,
and made some improvements in methods.</p>

<p>To him is also due the first serious attempt to measure
the density and hence the mass of the earth. By comparing
the attraction exerted by the earth with that of
the sun and other bodies, Newton, as we have seen
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_185">§&nbsp;185</a>), had been able to connect the masses
of several of the celestial bodies with that of the earth.
To connect the mass of the whole earth with that of a
given terrestrial body, and so express it in pounds or tons,
was a problem of quite a different kind. It is of course
possible to examine portions of the earth’s surface and
compare their density with that of, say, water; then to
make some conjecture, based on rough observations in
mines, etc., as to the rate at which density increases as
we go from the surface towards the centre of the earth,
and hence to infer the average density of the earth. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
the mass of the whole earth is compared with that of a
globe of water of the same size, and, the size being known,
is expressible in pounds or tons.</p>

<p>By a process of this sort Newton had in fact, with extraordinary
insight, estimated that the density of the earth
was between five and six times as great as that of water.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>It was, however, clearly desirable to solve the problem
in a less conjectural manner, by a direct comparison of
the gravitational attraction exerted by the earth with that
exerted by a known mass—a method that would at the
same time afford a valuable test of Newton’s theory of the
gravitating properties of portions of the earth, as distinguished
from the whole earth. In their Peruvian expedition (<a href="#para_221">§&nbsp;221</a>),
Bouguer and La Condamine had noticed certain small deflections
of the plumb-line, which indicated an attraction by
Chimborazo, near which they were working; but the observations
were too uncertain to be depended on. Maskelyne
selected for his purpose Schehallien in Perthshire, a narrow
ridge running east and west. The direction of the plumb-line
was observed (1774) on each side of the ridge, and
a change in direction amounting to about 12″ was found
to be caused by the attraction of the mountain. As the
direction of the plumb-line depends on the attraction of
the earth as a whole and on that of the mountain, this
deflection at once led to a comparison of the two attractions.
Hence an intricate calculation performed by <i>Charles
Hutton</i> (1737-1823) led to a comparison of the average
densities of the earth and mountain, and hence to the final
conclusion (published in 1778) that the earth’s density was
about 4-1∕2 times that of water. As Hutton’s estimate of the
density of the mountain was avowedly almost conjectural,
this result was of course correspondingly uncertain.</p>

<p>A few years later <i>John Michell</i> (1724-1793) suggested, and
the famous chemist and electrician <i>Henry Cavendish</i> (1731-1810)
carried out (1798), an experiment in which the
mountain was replaced by a pair of heavy balls, and their
attraction on another body was compared with that of the
earth, the result being that the density of the earth was
found to be about 5-1∕2 times that of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>The <b>Cavendish experiment</b>, as it is often called, has
since been repeated by various other experimenters in
modified forms, and one or two other methods, too technical
to be described here, have also been devised. All the
best modern experiments give for the density numbers
converging closely on 5-1∕2, thus verifying in a most striking
way both Newton’s conjecture and Cavendish’s original
experiment.</p>

<p>With this value of the density the mass of the earth is
a little more than 13 billion billion pounds, or more
precisely 13,136,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 lbs.</p>

<p><a id="para_220"></a>220. While Greenwich was furnishing the astronomical
world with a most valuable series of observations, the Paris
Observatory had not fulfilled its early promise. It was
in fact suffering, like English mathematics, from the evil
effects of undue adherence to the methods and opinions of
a distinguished man. Domenico Cassini happened to hold
several erroneous opinions in important astronomical
matters; he was too good a Catholic to be a genuine
Coppernican, he had no belief in gravitation, he was firmly
persuaded that the earth was flattened at the equator instead
of at the poles, and he rejected Roemer’s discovery of the
velocity of light. After his death in 1712 the directorship
of the Observatory passed in turn to three of his descendants,
the last of whom resigned office in 1793; and several
members of the Maraldi family, into which his sister had
married, worked in co-operation with their cousins. Unfortunately
a good deal of their energy was expended, first
in defending, and afterwards in gradually withdrawing from,
the errors of their distinguished head. <i>Jacques Cassini</i> for
example, the second of the family (1677-1756), although
a Coppernican, was still a timid one, and rejected Kepler’s
law of areas; his son again, commonly known as <i>Cassini de
Thury</i> (1714-1784), still defended the ancestral errors as
to the form of the earth; while the fourth member of the
family, <i>Count Cassini</i> (1748-1845), was the first of the
family to accept the Newtonian idea of gravitation.</p>

<p>Some planetary and other observations of value were
made by the Cassini-Maraldi school, but little of this work
was of first-rate importance.</p>

<p><a id="para_221"></a>221. A series of important measurements of the earth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
in which the Cassinis had a considerable share, were made
during the 18th century, almost entirely by Frenchmen,
and resulted in tolerably exact knowledge of the earth’s
size and shape.</p>

<p>The variation of the length of the seconds pendulum
observed by Richer in his Cayenne expedition (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>,
(<a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>) had been the first indication of a deviation of the
earth from a spherical form. Newton inferred, both from
these pendulum experiments and from an independent
theoretical investigation (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_187">§&nbsp;187</a>), that the earth
was spheroidal, being flattened towards the poles; and
this view was strengthened by the satisfactory explanation
of precession to which it led (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_188">§&nbsp;188</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, a comparison of various measurements
of arcs of the meridian in different latitudes gave some
support to the view that the earth was elongated towards
the poles and flattened towards the equator, a view championed
with great ardour by the Cassini school. It was
clearly important that the question should be settled by
more extensive and careful earth-measurements.</p>

<p>The essential part of an ordinary measurement of the
earth consists in ascertaining the distance in miles between
two places on the same meridian, the latitudes of which
differ by a known amount. From these two data the length
of an arc of a meridian corresponding to a difference of
latitude of 1° at once follows. The <b>latitude</b> of a place is
the angle which the vertical at the place makes with the
equator, or, expressed in a slightly different form, is the
angular distance of the zenith from the celestial equator.
The <b>vertical</b> at any place may be defined as a direction
perpendicular to the surface of still water at the place in
question, and may be regarded as perpendicular to the
true surface of the earth, accidental irregularities in its form
such as hills and valleys being ignored.<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>The difference of latitude between two places, north and
south of one another, is consequently the angle between
the verticals there. Fig. 78 shews the verticals, marked
by the arrowheads, at places on the same meridian in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
latitudes differing by 10°; so that two consecutive verticals
are inclined in every case at an angle of 10°.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_78"></a>
<img src="images/i_p277.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>—The varying curvature of the earth.</div>
</div>

<p>If, as in fig. 78, the shape of the earth is drawn in accordance
with Newton’s views, the figure shews at once that
the arcs <span class="smcap">A A<sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="smcap">A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub></span>, etc., each of which corresponds to 10° of
latitude, steadily <i>increase</i> as we pass from a point <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> on the
equator to the pole <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. If the opposite hypothesis be
adopted, which will be illustrated by the same figure if we
now regard <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> as the pole and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> as a point on the equator,
then the successive arcs <i>decrease</i> as we pass from equator
to pole. A comparison of the measurements made by
Eratosthenes in Egypt (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_36">§&nbsp;36</a>) with some made
in Europe (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_159">§&nbsp;159</a>) seemed to indicate that a
degree of the meridian near the equator was longer than
one in higher latitudes; and a similar conclusion was indicated
by a comparison of different portions of an extensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
French arc, about 9° in length, extending from Dunkirk
to the Pyrenees, which was measured under the superintendence
of the Cassinis in continuation of Picard’s arc,
the result being published by J. Cassini in 1720. In
neither case, however, were the data sufficiently accurate to
justify the conclusion; and the first decisive evidence was
obtained by measurement of arcs in places differing far
more widely in latitude than any that had hitherto been
available. The French Academy organised an expedition
to Peru, under the management of three Academicians,
<i>Pierre Bouguer</i> (1698-1758), <i>Charles Marie de La Condamine</i>
(1701-1774), and <i>Louis Godin</i> (1704-1760), with
whom two Spanish naval officers also co-operated.</p>

<p>The expedition started in 1735, and, owing to various
difficulties, the work was spread out over nearly ten years.
The most important result was the measurement, with very
fair accuracy, of an arc of about 3° in length, close to the
equator; but a number of pendulum experiments of value
were also performed, and a good many miscellaneous
additions to knowledge were made.</p>

<p>But while the Peruvian party were still at their work a
similar expedition to Lapland, under the Academician
<i>Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis</i> (1698-1759), had much
more rapidly (1736-7), if somewhat carelessly, effected the
measurement of an arc of nearly 1° close to the arctic circle.</p>

<p>From these measurements it resulted that the lengths
of a degree of a meridian about latitude 2° S. (Peru),
about latitude 47° N. (France) and about latitude 66° N.
(Lapland) were respectively 362,800 feet, 364,900 feet, and
367,100 feet.<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> There was therefore clear evidence, from
a comparison of any two of these arcs, of an increase of
the length of a degree of a meridian as the latitude increases;
and the general correctness of Newton’s views as against
Cassini’s was thus definitely established.</p>

<p>The extent to which the earth deviates from a sphere
is usually expressed by a fraction known as the <b>ellipticity</b>,
which is the difference between the lines <span class="smcap lowercase">C A</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C B</span> of fig. 78
divided by the greater of them. From comparison of the
three arcs just mentioned several very different values of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
ellipticity were deduced, the discrepancies being partly due
to different theoretical methods of interpreting the results
and partly to errors in the arcs.</p>

<p>A measurement, made by <i>Jöns Svanberg</i> (1771-1851) in
1801-3, of an arc near that of Maupertuis has in fact
shewn that his estimate of the length of a degree was
about 1,000 feet too large.</p>

<p>A large number of other arcs have been measured in
different parts of the earth at various times during the
18th and 19th centuries. The details of the measurements
need not be given, but to prevent recurrence to the subject
it is convenient to give here the results, obtained by a
comparison of these different measurements, that the
ellipticity is very nearly 1∕292, and the greatest radius of the
earth (<span class="smcap lowercase">C A</span> in fig. 78) a little less than 21,000,000 feet or
4,000 miles. It follows from these figures that the length
of a degree in the latitude of London contains, to use Sir
John Herschel’s ingenious mnemonic, almost exactly as
many thousand feet as the year contains days.</p>

<p><a id="para_222"></a>222. Reference has already been made to the supremacy
of Greenwich during the 18th century in the domain of
exact observation. France, however, produced during this
period one great observing astronomer who actually accomplished
much, and under more favourable external conditions
might almost have rivalled Bradley.</p>

<p><i>Nicholas Louis de Lacaille</i> was born in 1713. After he
had devoted a good deal of time to theological studies
with a view to an ecclesiastical career, his interests were
diverted to astronomy and mathematics. He was introduced
to Jacques Cassini, and appointed one of the
assistants at the Paris Observatory.</p>

<p>In 1738 and the two following years he took an active
part in the measurement of the French arc, then in process
of verification. While engaged in this work he was appointed
(1739) to a poorly paid professorship at the
Mazarin College, at which a small observatory was erected.
Here it was his regular practice to spend the whole night,
if fine, in observation, while “to fill up usefully the hours
of leisure which bad weather gives to observers only too
often” he undertook a variety of extensive calculations and
wrote innumerable scientific memoirs. It is therefore not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
surprising that he died comparatively early (1762) and that
his death was generally attributed to overwork.</p>

<p><a id="para_223"></a>223. The monotony of Lacaille’s outward life was broken
by the scientific expedition to the Cape of Good Hope
(1750-1754) organised by the Academy of Sciences and
placed under his direction.</p>

<p>The most striking piece of work undertaken during this
expedition was a systematic survey of the southern skies,
in the course of which more than 10,000 stars were
observed.</p>

<p>These observations, together with a carefully executed
catalogue of nearly 2,000 of the stars<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> and a star-map, were
published posthumously in 1763 under the title <i>Coelum
Australe Stelliferum</i>, and entirely superseded Halley’s much
smaller and less accurate catalogue (<a href="#para_199">§&nbsp;199</a>). Lacaille
found it necessary to make 14 new constellations (some
of which have since been generally abandoned), and to
restore to their original places the stars which the loyal
Halley had made into King Charles’s Oak. Incidentally
Lacaille observed and described 42 nebulae, nebulous stars,
and star-clusters, objects the systematic study of which
was one of Herschel’s great achievements (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>,
§§&nbsp;259-261).</p>

<p>He made a large number of pendulum experiments, at
Mauritius as well as at the Cape, with the usual object of
determining in a new part of the world the acceleration
due to gravity, and measured an arc of the meridian extending
over rather more than a degree. He made also
careful observations of the positions of Mars and Venus,
in order that from comparison of them with simultaneous
observations in northern latitudes he might get the parallax
of the sun (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>). These observations of
Mars compared with some made in Europe by Bradley and
others, and a similar treatment of Venus, both pointed to
a solar parallax slightly in excess of 10″, a result less
accurate than Cassini’s (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>), though
obtained by more reliable processes.</p>

<p>A large number of observations of the moon, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
those made by him at the Cape formed an important part,
led, after an elaborate discussion in which the spheroidal
form of the earth was taken into account, to an improved
value of the moon’s distance, first published in 1761.</p>

<p>Lacaille also used his observations of fixed stars to
improve our knowledge of refraction, and obtained a
number of observations of the sun in that part of its orbit
which it traverses in our winter months (the summer of
the southern hemisphere), and in which it is therefore
too near the horizon to be observed satisfactorily in
Europe.</p>

<p>The results of this—one of the most fruitful scientific
expeditions ever undertaken—were published in separate
memoirs or embodied in various books published after his
return to Paris.</p>

<p><a id="para_224"></a>224. In 1757, under the title <i>Astronomiae Fundamenta</i>,
appeared a catalogue of 400 of the brightest stars, observed
and reduced with the most scrupulous care, so that, notwithstanding
the poverty of Lacaille’s instrumental outfit,
the catalogue was far superior to any of its predecessors,
and was only surpassed by Bradley’s observations as they
were gradually published. It is characteristic of Lacaille’s
unselfish nature that he did not have the <i>Fundamenta</i> sold
in the ordinary way, but distributed copies gratuitously to
those interested in the subject, and earned the money
necessary to pay the expenses of publication by calculating
some astronomical almanacks.</p>

<p>Another catalogue, of rather more than 500 stars situated
in the zodiac, was published posthumously.</p>

<p>In the following year (1758) he published an excellent
set of Solar Tables, based on an immense series of observations
and calculations. These were remarkable as the first
in which planetary perturbations were taken into account.</p>

<p>Among Lacaille’s minor contributions to astronomy may
be mentioned: improved methods of calculating cometary
orbits and the actual calculation of the orbits of a large
number of recorded comets, the calculation of all eclipses
visible in Europe since the year 1, a warning that the
transit of Venus would be capable of far less accurate
observation than Halley had expected (<a href="#para_202">§&nbsp;202</a>), observations
of the actual transit of 1761 (<a href="#para_227">§&nbsp;227</a>), and a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
improvements in methods of calculation and of utilising
observations.</p>

<p>In estimating the immense mass of work which Lacaille
accomplished during an astronomical career of about 22
years, it has also to be borne in mind that he had only
moderately good instruments at his observatory, and <i>no
assistant</i>, and that a considerable part of his time had to
be spent in earning the means of living and of working.</p>

<p><a id="para_225"></a>225. During the period under consideration Germany
also produced one astronomer, primarily an observer, of
great merit, <i>Tobias Mayer</i> (1723-1762). He was appointed
professor of mathematics and political economy at Göttingen
in 1751, apparently on the understanding that he need not
lecture on the latter subject, of which indeed he seems
to have professed no knowledge; three years later he was
put in charge of the observatory, which had been erected
20 years before. He had at least one fine instrument,<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
and following the example of Tycho, Flamsteed, and Bradley,
he made a careful study of its defects, and carried further
than any of his predecessors the theory of correcting
observations for instrumental errors.<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>He improved Lacaille’s tables of the sun, and made a
catalogue of 998 zodiacal stars, published posthumously in
1775; by a comparison of star places recorded by Roemer
(1706) with his own and Lacaille’s observations he obtained
evidence of a considerable number of proper motions
(<a href="#para_203">§&nbsp;203</a>); and he made a number of other less interesting
additions to astronomical knowledge.</p>

<p><a id="para_226"></a>226. But Mayer’s most important work was on the moon.
At the beginning of his career he made a careful study of
the position of the craters and other markings, and was
thereby able to get a complete geometrical explanation of
the various librations of the moon (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_133">§&nbsp;133</a>), and
to fix with accuracy the position of the axis about which
the moon rotates. A map of the moon based on his
observations was published with other posthumous works
in 1775.</p>

<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 282.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>Much more important, however, were his lunar theory
and the tables based on it. The intrinsic mathematical
interest of the problem of the motion of the moon, and its
practical importance for the determination of longitude, had
caused a great deal of attention to be given to the subject
by the astronomers of the 18th century. A further stimulus
was also furnished by the prizes offered by the British
Government in 1713 for a method of finding the longitude
at sea, <i>viz.</i> £20,000 for a method reliable to within half
a degree, and smaller amounts for methods of less accuracy.</p>

<p>All the great mathematicians of the period made attempts
at deducing the moon’s motions from gravitational principles.
Mayer worked out a theory in accordance with methods
used by Euler (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_233">§&nbsp;233</a>), but made a much more
liberal and also more skilful use of observations to determine
various numerical quantities, which pure theory gave either
not at all or with considerable uncertainty. He accordingly
succeeded in calculating tables of the moon (published with
those of the sun in 1753) which were a notable improvement
on those of any earlier writer. After making further
improvements, he sent them in 1755 to England. Bradley,
to whom the Admiralty submitted them for criticism, reported
favourably of their accuracy; and a few years later,
after making some alterations in the tables on the basis of
his own observations, he recommended to the Admiralty a
longitude method based on their use which he estimated
to be in general capable of giving the longitude within
about half a degree.</p>

<p>Before anything definite was done, Mayer died at the
early age of 39, leaving behind him a new set of tables,
which were also sent to England. Ultimately £3,000 was
paid to his widow in 1765; and both his <i>Theory of the
Moon</i><a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> and his improved Solar and Lunar Tables were
published in 1770 at the expense of the Board of Longitude.
A later edition, improved by Bradley’s former assistant
<i>Charles Mason</i> (1730-1787), appeared in 1787.</p>

<p>A prize was also given to Euler for his theoretical work;
while £3,000 and subsequently £10,000 more were awarded
to <i>John Harrison</i> for improvements in the chronometer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
which rendered practicable an entirely different method
of finding the longitude (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_127">§&nbsp;127</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_227"></a>227. The astronomers of the 18th century had two
opportunities of utilising a transit of Venus for the determination
of the distance of the sun, as recommended by
Halley (<a href="#para_202">§&nbsp;202</a>).</p>

<p>A passage or transit of Venus across the sun’s disc is
a phenomenon of the same nature as an eclipse of the
sun by the moon, with the important difference that the
apparent magnitude of the planet is too small to cause any
serious diminution in the sun’s light, and it merely appears
as a small black dot on the bright surface of the sun.</p>

<p>If the path of Venus lay in the ecliptic, then at every
inferior conjunction, occurring once in 584 days, she would
necessarily pass between the sun and earth and would
appear to transit. As, however, the paths of Venus and the
earth are inclined to one another, at inferior conjunction
Venus is usually far enough “above” or “below” the
ecliptic for no transit to occur. With the present position
of the two paths—which planetary perturbations are only
very gradually changing—transits of Venus occur in pairs
eight years apart, while between the latter of one pair and
the earlier of the next pair elapse alternately intervals of
105-1∕2 and of 121-1∕2 years. Thus transits have taken place in
December 1631 and 1639, June 1761 and 1769, December
1874 and 1882, and will occur again in 2004 and 2012,
2117 and 2125, and so on.</p>

<p>The method of getting the distance of the sun from a
transit of Venus may be said not to differ essentially from
that based on observations of Mars (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>).</p>

<p>The observer’s object in both cases is to obtain the
difference in direction of the planet as seen from different
places on the earth. Venus, however, when at all near
the earth, is usually too near the sun in the sky to be
capable of minutely exact observation, but when a transit
occurs the sun’s disc serves as it were as a dial-plate on
which the position of the planet can be noted. Moreover
the measurement of minute angles, an art not yet carried
to very great perfection in the 18th century, can be avoided
by time-observations, as the difference in the times at
which Venus enters (or leaves) the sun’s disc as seen at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
different stations, or the difference in the durations of the
transit, can be without difficulty translated into difference
of direction, and the distances of Venus and the sun can
be deduced.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>Immense trouble was taken by Governments, Academies,
and private persons in arranging for the observation of the
transits of 1761 and 1769. For the former observing
parties were sent as far as to Tobolsk, St. Helena, the
Cape of Good Hope, and India, while observations were
also made by astronomers at Greenwich, Paris, Vienna,
Upsala, and elsewhere in Europe. The next transit was
observed on an even larger scale, the stations selected
ranging from Siberia to California, from the Varanger Fjord
to Otaheiti (where no less famous a person than Captain
Cook was placed), and from Hudson’s Bay to Madras.</p>

<p>The expeditions organised on this occasion by the
American Philosophical Society may be regarded as the
first of the contributions made by America to the science
which has since owed so much to her; while the Empress
Catherine bore witness to the newly acquired civilisation of
her country by arranging a number of observing stations
on Russian soil.</p>

<p>The results were far more in accordance with Lacaille’s
anticipations than with Halley’s. A variety of causes prevented
the moments of contact between the discs of Venus
and the sun from being observed with the precision that
had been hoped. By selecting different sets of observations,
and by making different allowances for the various probable
sources of error, a number of discordant results were
obtained by various calculators. The values of the parallax
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>) of the sun deduced from the earlier
of the two transits ranged between about 8″ and 10″; while
those obtained in 1769, though much more consistent, still
varied between about 8″ and 9″, corresponding to a variation
of about 10,000,000 miles in the distance of the sun.</p>

<p>The whole set of observations were subsequently very
elaborately discussed in 1822-4 and again in 1835 by
<i>Johann Franz Encke</i> (1791-1865), who deduced a parallax
of 8″·571, corresponding to a distance of 95,370,000 miles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
a number which long remained classical. The uncertainty
of the data is, however, shewn by the fact that other equally
competent astronomers have deduced from the observations
of 1769 parallaxes of 8″·8 and 8″·9.</p>

<p>No account has yet been given of William Herschel,
perhaps the most famous of all observers, whose career
falls mainly into the last quarter of the 18th century and
the earlier part of the 19th century. As, however, his
work was essentially different from that of almost all the
astronomers of the 18th century, and gave a powerful
impulse to a department of astronomy hitherto almost
ignored, it is convenient to postpone to a later chapter (<span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>)
the discussion of his work.</p>

<small>GRAVITATIONAL ASTRONOMY IN THE 18TH CENTURY.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“Astronomy, considered in the most general way, is a great problem
of mechanics, the arbitrary data of which are the elements of the
celestial movements; its solution depends both on the accuracy of
observations and on the perfection of analysis.”</p>

</p></blockquote>


<p><a id="para_228"></a>228. The solar system, as it was known at the beginning
of the 18th century, contained 18 recognised members:
the sun, six planets, ten satellites (one belonging to the
earth, four to Jupiter, and five to Saturn), and Saturn’s
ring.</p>

<p>Comets were known to have come on many occasions
into the region of space occupied by the solar system, and
there were reasons to believe that one of them at least
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_200">§&nbsp;200</a>) was a regular visitor; they were, however,
scarcely regarded as belonging to the solar system,
and their action (if any) on its members was ignored, a
neglect which subsequent investigation has completely
justified. Many thousands of fixed stars had also been
observed, and their places on the celestial sphere determined;
they were known to be at very great though unknown
distances from the solar system, and their influence on it
was regarded as insensible.</p>

<p>The motions of the 18 members of the solar system were
tolerably well known; their actual distances from one
another had been roughly estimated, while the <i>proportions</i>
between most of the distances were known with considerable
accuracy. Apart from the entirely anomalous ring of
Saturn, which may for the present be left out of consideration,
most of the bodies of the system were known from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
observation to be nearly spherical in form, and the rest were
generally supposed to be so also.</p>

<p>Newton had shewn, with a considerable degree of probability,
that these bodies attracted one another according to
the law of gravitation; and there was no reason to suppose
that they exerted any other important influence on one
another’s motions.<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>The problem which presented itself, and which may conveniently
be called Newton’s problem, was therefore:—</p>

<p><i>Given these 18 bodies, and their positions and motions
at any time, to deduce from their mutual gravitation by
a process of mathematical calculation their positions and
motions at any other time; and to shew that these agree
with those actually observed.</i></p>

<p>Such a calculation would necessarily involve, among other
quantities, the masses of the several bodies; it was evidently
legitimate to assume these at will in such a way as to make
the results of calculation agree with those of observation.
If this were done successfully the masses would thereby be
determined. In the same way the commonly accepted
estimates of the dimensions of the solar system and of the
shapes of its members might be modified in any way not
actually inconsistent with direct observation.</p>

<p>The general problem thus formulated can fortunately be
reduced to somewhat simpler ones.</p>

<p>Newton had shewn (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_182">§&nbsp;182</a>) that an ordinary
sphere attracted other bodies and was attracted by them,
as if its mass were concentrated at its centre; and that the
effects of deviation from a spherical form became very
small at a considerable distance from the body. Hence,
except in special cases, the bodies of the solar system could
be treated as spheres, which could again be regarded as
concentrated at their respective centres. It will be convenient
for the sake of brevity to assume for the future
that all “bodies” referred to are of this sort, unless the
contrary is stated or implied. The effects of deviations
from spherical form could then be treated separately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
when required, as in the cases of precession and of
other motions of a planet or satellite about its centre, and
of the corresponding action of a non-spherical planet on its
satellites; to this group of problems belongs also that of the
tides and other cases of the motion of parts of a body of
any form relative to the rest.</p>

<p>Again, the solar system happens to be so constituted that
each body’s motion can be treated as determined primarily
by one other body only. A planet, for example, moves
nearly as if no other body but the sun existed, and the
moon’s motion relative to the earth is roughly the same as
if the other bodies of the solar system were non-existent.</p>

<p>The problem of the motion of two mutually gravitating
spheres was completely solved by Newton, and was
shewn to lead to Kepler’s first two laws. Hence each
body of the solar system could be regarded as moving
nearly in an ellipse round some one body, but as slightly
disturbed by the action of others. Moreover, by a general
mathematical principle applicable in problems of motion,
the effect of a number of small disturbing causes acting
conjointly is nearly the same as that which results from
adding together their separate effects. Hence each body
could, without great error, be regarded as disturbed by one
body at a time; the several disturbing effects could then
be added together, and a fresh calculation could be made
to further diminish the error. The kernel of Newton’s
problem is thus seen to be a special case of the so-called
<b>problem of three bodies</b>, viz.:—</p>

<p><i>Given at any time the positions and motions of three
mutually gravitating bodies, to determine their positions and
motions at any other time.</i></p>

<p>Even this apparently simple problem in its general form
entirely transcends the powers, not only of the mathematical
methods of the early 18th century, but also of
those that have been devised since. Certain special cases
have been solved, so that it has been shewn to be possible
to suppose three bodies initially moving in such a way that
their future motion can be completely determined. But
these cases do not occur in nature.</p>

<p>In the case of the solar system the problem is simplified,
not only by the consideration already mentioned that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
of the three bodies can always be regarded as exercising
only a small influence on the relative motion of the other
two, but also by the facts that the orbits of the planets
and satellites do not differ much from circles, and that
the planes of their orbits are in no case inclined at large
angles to any one of them, such as the ecliptic; in other
words, that the eccentricities and inclinations are small
quantities.</p>

<p>Thus simplified, the problem has been found to admit
of solutions of considerable accuracy by methods of
approximation.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>In the case of the system formed by the sun, earth,
and moon, the characteristic feature is the great distance
of the sun, which is the disturbing body, from the other
two bodies; in the case of the sun and two planets, the
enormous mass of the sun as compared with the disturbing
planet is the important factor. Hence the methods of
treatment suitable for the two cases differ, and two substantially
distinct branches of the subject, <b>lunar theory</b> and
<b>planetary theory</b>, have developed. The problems presented
by the motions of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, though
allied to those of the lunar theory, differ in some important
respects, and are usually treated separately.</p>

<p><a id="para_229"></a>229. As we have seen, Newton made a number of
important steps towards the solution of his problem, but
little was done by his successors in his own country. On
the Continent also progress was at first very slow. The
<i>Principia</i> was read and admired by most of the leading
mathematicians of the time, but its principles were not
accepted, and Cartesianism remained the prevailing philosophy.
A forward step is marked by the publication by
the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1720 of a memoir written
by the <i>Chevalier de Louville</i> (1671-1732) on the basis of
Newton’s principles; ten years later the Academy awarded
a prize to an essay on the planetary motions written by
<i>John Bernouilli</i> (1667-1748) on Cartesian principles, a
Newtonian essay being put second. In 1732 Maupertuis
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_221">§&nbsp;221</a>) published a treatise on the figure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
earth on Newtonian lines, and the appearance six years later
of Voltaire’s extremely readable <i>Éléments de la Philosophie de
Newton</i> had a great effect in popularising the new ideas.
The last official recognition of Cartesianism in France
seems to have been in 1740, when the prize offered by the
Academy for an essay on the tides was shared between
a Cartesian and three eminent Newtonians (<a href="#para_230">§&nbsp;230</a>).</p>

<p>The rapid development of gravitational astronomy that
ensued between this time and the beginning of the
19th century was almost entirely the work of five great
Continental mathematicians, Euler, Clairaut, D’Alembert,
Lagrange, and Laplace, of whom the eldest was born in
1707 and the youngest died in 1827, within a month of the
centenary of Newton’s death. Euler was a Swiss, Lagrange
was of Italian birth but French by extraction and to a great
extent by adoption, and the other three were entirely
French. France therefore during nearly the whole of the
18th century reigned supreme in gravitational astronomy,
and has not lost her supremacy even to-day, though during
the present century America, England, Germany, Italy, and
other countries have all made substantial contributions to
the subject.</p>

<p>It is convenient to consider first the work of the three
first-named astronomers, and to treat later Lagrange and
Laplace, who carried gravitational astronomy to a decidedly
higher stage of development than their predecessors.</p>

<p><a id="para_230"></a>230. <i>Leonhard Euler</i> was born at Basle in 1707, 14 years
later than Bradley and six years earlier than Lacaille. He
was the son of a Protestant minister who had studied
mathematics under <i>James Bernouilli</i> (1654-1705), the first of
a famous family of mathematicians. Leonhard Euler himself
was a favourite pupil of John Bernouilli (the younger
brother of James), and was an intimate friend of his two
sons, one of whom, <i>Daniel</i> (1700-1782), was not only a distinguished
mathematician like his father and uncle, but was
also the first important Newtonian outside Great Britain.
Like so many other astronomers, Euler began by studying
theology, but was induced both by his natural tastes and
by the influence of the Bernouillis to turn his attention to
mathematics. Through the influence of Daniel Bernouilli,
who had recently been appointed to a professorship at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
St. Petersburg, Euler received and accepted an invitation
to join the newly created Academy of Sciences there (1727).
This first appointment carried with it a stipend, and the
duties were the general promotion of science; subsequently
Euler undertook more definite professorial work, but most
of his energy during the whole of his career was
devoted to writing mathematical papers, the majority of
which were published by the St. Petersburg Academy.
Though he took no part in politics, Russian autocracy
appears to have been oppressive to him, reared as he had
been among Swiss and Protestant surroundings; and in
1741 he accepted an invitation from Frederick the Great,
a despot of a less pronounced type, to come to Berlin, and
assist in reorganising the Academy of Sciences there. On
being reproached one day by the Queen for his taciturn
and melancholy demeanour, he justified his silence on the
ground that he had just come from a country where speech
was liable to lead to hanging;<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> but notwithstanding this
frank criticism he remained on good terms with the Russian
court, and continued to draw his stipend as a member
of the St. Petersburg Academy and to contribute to its
Transactions. Moreover, after 25 years spent at Berlin, he
accepted a pressing invitation from the Empress Catherine II.
and returned to Russia (1766).</p>

<p>He had lost the use of one eye in 1735, a disaster which
called from him the remark that he would henceforward
have less to distract him from his mathematics; the second
eye went soon after his return to Russia, and with the
exception of a short time during which an operation restored
the partial use of one eye he remained blind till the end
of his life. But this disability made little difference to his
astounding scientific activity; and it was only after nearly
17 years of blindness that as a result of a fit of apoplexy
“he ceased to live and to calculate” (1783).</p>

<p>Euler was probably the most versatile as well as the most
prolific of mathematicians of all time. There is scarcely
any branch of modern analysis to which he was not a large
contributor, and his extraordinary powers of devising and
applying methods of calculation were employed by him
with great success in each of the existing branches of applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
mathematics; problems of abstract dynamics, of optics, of
the motion of fluids, and of astronomy were all in turn
subjected to his analysis and solved. The extent of his
writings is shewn by the fact that, in addition to several
books, he wrote about 800 papers on mathematical and
physical subjects; it is estimated that a complete edition
of his works would occupy 25 quarto volumes of about
600 pages each.</p>

<p>Euler’s first contribution to astronomy was an essay on
the tides which obtained a share of the Academy prize for
1740 already referred to, Daniel Bernouilli and Maclaurin
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_196">§&nbsp;196</a>) being the other two Newtonians. The
problem of the tides was, however, by no means solved by
any of the three writers.</p>

<p>He gave two distinct solutions of the problem of three
bodies in a form suitable for the lunar theory, and made
a number of extremely important and suggestive though
incomplete contributions to planetary theory. In both
subjects his work was so closely connected with that of
Clairaut and D’Alembert that it is more convenient to
discuss it in connection with theirs.</p>

<p><a id="para_231"></a>231. <i>Alexis Claude Clairaut</i>, born at Paris in 1713,
belongs to the class of precocious geniuses. He read the
Infinitesimal Calculus and Conic Sections at the age of ten,
presented a scientific memoir to the Academy of Sciences
before he was 13, and published a book containing some
important contributions to geometry when he was 18,
thereby winning his admission to the Academy.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he took part in Maupertuis’ expedition
to Lapland (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_221">§&nbsp;221</a>), and after publishing several
papers of minor importance produced in 1743 his classical
work on the figure of the earth. In this he discussed in
a far more complete form than either Newton or Maclaurin
the form which a rotating body like the earth assumes
under the influence of the mutual gravitation of its parts,
certain hypotheses of a very general nature being made as
to the variations of density in the interior; and deduced
formulae for the changes in different latitudes of the acceleration
due to gravity, which are in satisfactory agreement with
the results of pendulum experiments.</p>

<p>Although the subject has since been more elaborately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and more generally treated by later writers, and a good
many additions have been made, few if any results of
fundamental importance have been added to those contained
in Clairaut’s book.</p>

<p>He next turned his attention to the problem of three
bodies, obtained a solution suitable for the moon, and made
some progress in planetary theory.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>—The path of Halley’s comet.</div>
</div>

<p>Halley’s comet (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_200">§&nbsp;200</a>) was “due” about
1758; as the time approached Clairaut took up the task
of computing the perturbations which it would probably have
experienced since its last appearance, owing to the influence
of the two great planets, Jupiter and Saturn, close to both
of which it would have passed. An extremely laborious
calculation shewed that the comet would have been retarded
about 100 days by Saturn and about 518 days by Jupiter,
and he accordingly announced to the Academy towards the
end of 1758 that the comet might be expected to pass its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
perihelion (the point of its orbit nearest the sun, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> in fig. 80)
about April 13th of the following year, though owing to
various defects in his calculation there might be an error of
a month either way. The comet was anxiously watched for
by the astronomical world, and was actually discovered by
an amateur, <i>George Palitzsch</i> (1723-1788) of Saxony, on
Christmas Day, 1758; it passed its perihelion just a month
and a day before the time assigned by Clairaut.</p>

<p>Halley’s brilliant conjecture was thus justified; a new
member was added to the solar system, and hopes were
raised—to be afterwards amply fulfilled—that in other
cases also the motions of comets might be reduced to
rule, and calculated according to the same principles as
those of less erratic bodies. The superstitions attached
to comets were of course at the same time still further
shaken.</p>

<p>Clairaut appears to have had great personal charm and
to have been a conspicuous figure in Paris society. Unfortunately
his strength was not equal to the combined
claims of social and scientific labours, and he died in 1765
at an age when much might still have been hoped from his
extraordinary abilities.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p><a id="para_232"></a>232. <i>Jean-le-Rond D’Alembert</i> was found in 1717 as an
infant on the steps of the church of St. Jean-le-Rond in
Paris, but was afterwards recognised, and to some extent
provided for, by his father, though his home was with his
foster parents. After receiving a fair school education,
he studied law and medicine, but then turned his attention
to mathematics. He first attracted notice in mathematical
circles by a paper written in 1738, and was admitted to
the Academy of Sciences two years afterwards. His earliest
important work was the <i>Traité de Dynamique</i> (1743), which
contained, among other contributions to the subject, the
first statement of a dynamical principle which bears his
name, and which, though in one sense only a corollary
from Newton’s Third Law of Motion, has proved to be of
immense service in nearly all general dynamical problems,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
astronomical or otherwise. During the next few years he
made a number of contributions to mathematical physics,
as well as to the problem of three bodies; and published
in 1749 his work on precession and nutation, already
referred to (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_215">§&nbsp;215</a>). From this time onwards
he began to give an increasing part of his energies to work
outside mathematics. For some years he collaborated
with Diderot in producing the famous French Encyclopaedia,
which began to appear in 1751, and exercised so great
an influence on contemporary political and philosophic
thought. D’Alembert wrote the introduction, which was
read to the <i>Académie Française</i><a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> in 1754 on the occasion
of his admission to that distinguished body, as well as a
variety of scientific and other articles. In the later part
of his life, which ended in 1783, he wrote little on mathematics,
but published a number of books on philosophical,
literary, and political subjects;<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> as secretary of the
Academy he also wrote obituary notices (<i>éloges</i>) of some
70 of its members. He was thus, in Carlyle’s words, “of
great faculty, especially of great clearness and method;
famous in Mathematics; no less so, to the wonder of some,
in the intellectual provinces of Literature.”</p>

<p>D’Alembert and Clairaut were great rivals, and almost
every work of the latter was severely criticised by the
former, while Clairaut retaliated though with much less
zeal and vehemence. The great popular reputation acquired
by Clairaut through his work on Halley’s comet appears
to have particularly excited D’Alembert’s jealousy. The
rivalry, though not a pleasant spectacle, was, however, useful
in leading to the detection and subsequent improvement
of various weak points in the work of each. In other
respects D’Alembert’s personal characteristics appear to
have been extremely pleasant. He was always a poor
man, but nevertheless declined magnificent offers made to
him by both Catherine II. of Russia and Frederick the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Great of Prussia, and preferred to keep his independence,
though he retained the friendship of both sovereigns and
accepted a small pension from the latter. He lived extremely
simply, and notwithstanding his poverty was very
generous to his foster-mother, to various young students,
and to many others with whom he came into contact.</p>

<p><a id="para_233"></a>233. Euler, Clairaut, and D’Alembert all succeeded in
obtaining independently and nearly simultaneously solutions
of the problem of three bodies in a form suitable for lunar
theory. Euler published in 1746 some rather imperfect
Tables of the Moon, which shewed that he must have
already obtained his solution. Both Clairaut and D’Alembert
presented to the Academy in 1747 memoirs containing
their respective solutions, with applications to the moon
as well as to some planetary problems. In each of these
memoirs occurred the same difficulty which Newton had
met with: the calculated motion of the moon’s apogee was
only about half the observed result. Clairaut at first met
this difficulty by assuming an alteration in the law of gravitation,
and got a result which seemed to him satisfactory
by assuming gravitation to vary partly as the inverse square
and partly as the inverse cube of the distance.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Euler also
had doubts as to the correctness of the inverse square.
Two years later, however (1749), on going through his
original calculation again, Clairaut discovered that certain
terms, which had appeared unimportant at the beginning of
the calculation and had therefore been omitted, became
important later on. When these were taken into account,
the motion of the apogee as deduced from theory agreed
very nearly with that observed. This was the first of several
cases in which a serious discrepancy between theory and
observation has at first discredited the law of gravitation,
but has subsequently been explained away, and has thereby
given a new verification of its accuracy. When Clairaut
had announced his discovery, Euler arrived by a fresh
calculation at substantially the same result, while D’Alembert
by carrying the approximation further obtained one that
was slightly more accurate. A fresh calculation of the
motion of the moon by Clairaut won the prize on the
subject offered by the St. Petersburg Academy, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
published in 1752, with the title <i>Théorie de la Lune</i>. Two
years later he published a set of lunar tables, and just before
his death (1765) he brought out a revised edition of the
<i>Théorie de la Lune</i> in which he embodied a new set of
tables.</p>

<p>D’Alembert followed his paper of 1747 by a complete
lunar theory (with a moderately good set of tables), which,
though substantially finished in 1751, was only published
in 1754 as the first volume of his <i>Recherches sur différens
points importans du système du Monde</i>. In 1756 he published
an improved set of tables, and a few months afterward
a third volume of <i>Recherches</i> with some fresh developments
of the theory. The second volume of his <i>Opuscules
Mathématiques</i> (1762) contained another memoir on the
subject with a third set of tables, which were a slight
improvement on the earlier ones.</p>

<p>Euler’s first lunar theory (<i>Theoria Motuum Lunae</i>) was
published in 1753, though it had been sent to the St.
Petersburg Academy a year or two earlier. In an appendix<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
he points out with characteristic frankness the defects from
which his treatment seems to him to suffer, and suggests
a new method of dealing with the subject. It was on this
theory that Tobias Mayer based his tables, referred to in
the preceding chapter (<a href="#para_226">§&nbsp;226</a>). Many years later Euler
devised an entirely new way of attacking the subject, and
after some preliminary papers dealing generally with the
method and with special parts of the problem, he worked
out the lunar theory in great detail, with the help of one
of his sons and two other assistants, and published the
whole, together with tables, in 1772. He attempted, but
without success, to deal in this theory with the secular
acceleration of the mean motion which Halley had detected
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_201">§&nbsp;201</a>).</p>

<p>In any mathematical treatment of an astronomical problem
some data have to be borrowed from observation, and of
the three astronomers Clairaut seems to have been the most
skilful in utilising observations, many of which he obtained
from Lacaille. Hence his tables represented the actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
motions of the moon far more accurately than those of
D’Alembert, and were even superior in some points to those
based on Euler’s very much more elaborate second theory;
Clairaut’s last tables were seldom in error more than 1-1∕2′,
and would hence serve to determine the longitude to
within about 3∕4°. Clairaut’s tables were, however, never
much used, since Tobias Mayer’s as improved by
Bradley were found in practice to be a good deal more
accurate; but Mayer borrowed so extensively from observation
that his formulae cannot be regarded as true deductions
from gravitation in the same sense in which Clairaut’s were.
Mathematically Euler’s second theory is the most interesting
and was of the greatest importance as a basis for later
developments. The most modern lunar theory<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> is in
some sense a return to Euler’s methods.</p>

<p><a id="para_234"></a>234. Newton’s lunar theory may be said to have given a
<i>qualitative</i> account of the lunar inequalities known by
observation at the time when the <i>Principia</i> was published,
and to have indicated others which had not yet been
observed. But his attempts to explain these irregularities
<i>quantitatively</i> were only partially successful.</p>

<p>Euler, Clairaut, and D’Alembert threw the lunar theory
into an entirely new form by using analytical methods
instead of geometrical; one advantage of this was that by
the expenditure of the necessary labour calculations could
in general be carried further when required and lead to a
higher degree of accuracy. The result of their more
elaborate development was that—with one exception—the
inequalities known from observation were explained with a
considerable degree of accuracy quantitatively as well as
qualitatively; and thus tables, such as those of Clairaut,
based on theory, represented the lunar motions very closely.
The one exception was the secular acceleration: we have
just seen that Euler failed to explain it; D’Alembert was
equally unsuccessful, and Clairaut does not appear to have
considered the question.</p>

<p><a id="para_235"></a>235. The chief inequalities in planetary motion which
observation had revealed up to Newton’s time were the
forward motion of the apses of the earth’s orbit and a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
slow diminution in the obliquity of the ecliptic. To these
may be added the alterations in the rates of motion of
Jupiter and Saturn discovered by Halley (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_204">§&nbsp;204</a>).</p>

<p>Newton had shewn generally that the perturbing effect of
another planet would cause displacements in the apses
of any planetary orbit, and an alteration in the relative
positions of the planes in which the disturbing and disturbed
planet moved; but he had made no detailed calculations.
Some effects of this general nature, in addition to those
already known, were, however, indicated with more or less
distinctness as the result of observation in various planetary
tables published between the date of the <i>Principia</i> and the
middle of the 18th century.</p>

<p>The irregularities in the motion of the earth, shewing
themselves as irregularities in the apparent motion of the
sun, and those of Jupiter and Saturn, were the most
interesting and important of the planetary inequalities, and
prizes for essays on one or another subject were offered
several times by the Paris Academy.</p>

<p>The perturbations of the moon necessarily involved—by
the principle of action and reaction—corresponding though
smaller perturbations of the earth; these were discussed on
various occasions by Clairaut and Euler, and still more
fully by D’Alembert.</p>

<p>In Clairaut’s paper of 1747 (<a href="#para_233">§&nbsp;233</a>) he made some
attempt to apply his solution of the problem of three bodies
to the case of the sun, earth, and Saturn, which on account
of Saturn’s great distance from the sun (nearly ten times
that of the earth) is the planetary case most like that of the
earth, moon, and sun (cf. <a href="#para_228">§&nbsp;228</a>).</p>

<p>Ten years later he discussed in some detail the perturbations
of the earth due to Venus and to the moon. This
paper was remarkable as containing the first attempt to
estimate masses of celestial bodies by observation of perturbations
due to them. Clairaut applied this method to
the moon and to Venus, by calculating perturbations in
the earth’s motion due to their action (which necessarily
depended on their masses), and then comparing the results
with Lacaille’s observations of the sun. The mass of the
moon was thus found to be about 1∕67 and that of Venus
2∕3 that of the earth; the first result was a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
improvement on Newton’s estimate from tides (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>,
<a href="#para_189">§&nbsp;189</a>), and the second, which was entirely new, previous
estimates having been merely conjectural, is in tolerable
agreement with modern measurements.<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> It is worth
noticing as a good illustration of the reciprocal influence
of observation and mathematical theory that, while Clairaut
used Lacaille’s observations for his theory, Lacaille in turn
used Clairaut’s calculations of the perturbations of the
earth to improve his tables of the sun published in 1758.</p>

<p>Clairaut’s method of solving the problem of three bodies
was also applied by <i>Joseph Jérôme Le François Lalande</i>
(1732-1807), who is chiefly known as an admirable populariser
of astronomy but was also an indefatigable calculator
and observer, to the perturbations of Mars by Jupiter, of
Venus by the earth, and of the earth by Mars, but with
only moderate success.</p>

<p>D’Alembert made some progress with the general treatment
of planetary perturbations in the second volume of
his <i>Recherches</i>, and applied his methods to Jupiter and
Saturn.</p>

<p><a id="para_236"></a>236. Euler carried the general theory a good deal further
in a series of papers beginning in 1747. He made several
attempts to explain the irregularities of Jupiter and Saturn,
but never succeeded in representing the observations satisfactorily.
He shewed, however, that the perturbations due to
the other planets would cause the earth’s apse line to advance
about 13″ annually, and the obliquity of the ecliptic to
diminish by about 48″ annually, both results being in fair
accordance both with observations and with more elaborate
calculations made subsequently. He indicated also the
existence of various other planetary irregularities, which for
the most part had not previously been observed.</p>

<p>In an essay to which the Academy awarded a prize
in 1756, but which was first published in 1771, he developed
with some completeness a method of dealing with perturbations
which he had indicated in his lunar theory
of 1753. As this method, known as that of the <b>variation
of the elements</b> or <b>parameters</b>, played a very important part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
in subsequent researches, it may be worth while to attempt
to give a sketch of it.</p>

<p>If perturbations are ignored, a planet can be regarded as
moving in an ellipse with the sun in one focus. The size and
shape of the ellipse can be defined by the length of its axis
and by the eccentricity; the plane in which the ellipse is
situated is determined by the position of the line, called the
line of <b>nodes</b>, in which it cuts a fixed plane, usually taken
to be the ecliptic, and by the inclination of the two planes.
When these four quantities are fixed, the ellipse may still
turn about its focus in its own plane, but if the direction
of the apse line is also fixed the ellipse is completely
determined. If, further, the position of the planet in its
ellipse at any one time is known, the motion is completely
determined and its position at any other time can be
calculated. There are thus six quantities known as <b>elements</b>
which completely determine the motion of a planet not
subject to perturbation.</p>

<p>When perturbations are taken into account, the path
described by a planet in any one revolution is no longer
an ellipse, though it differs very slightly from one; while in
the case of the moon the deviations are a good deal greater.
But if the motions of a planet at two widely different
epochs are compared, though on each occasion the path
described is very nearly an ellipse, the ellipses differ in
some respects. For example, between the time of Ptolemy
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 150) and that of Euler the direction of the apse line
of the earth’s orbit altered by about 5°, and some of the
other elements also varied slightly. Hence in dealing with
the motion of a planet through a long period of time it is
convenient to introduce the idea of an elliptic path which
is gradually changing its position and possibly also its size
and shape. One consequence is that the actual path
described in the course of a considerable number of
revolutions is a curve no longer bearing much resemblance
to an ellipse. If, for example, the apse line turns round
uniformly while the other elements remain unchanged, the
path described is like that shewn in the figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_81"></a>
<img src="images/i_p303.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>—A varying ellipse.</div>
</div>

<p>Euler extended this idea so as to represent any perturbation
of a planet, whether experienced in the course
of one revolution or in a longer time, by means of changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
in an elliptic orbit. For wherever a planet may be and
whatever (within certain limits<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>) be its speed or direction
of motion some ellipse can be found, having the sun in
one focus, such that the planet can be regarded as moving
in it for a short time. Hence as the planet describes a
perturbed orbit it can be regarded as moving at any instant
in an ellipse, which, however, is continually altering its
position or other characteristics. Thus the problem of
discussing the planet’s motion becomes that of determining
the elements of the ellipse which represents its motion at
any time. Euler shewed further how, when the position
of the perturbing planet was known, the corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
rates of change of the elements of the varying ellipse
could be calculated, and made some progress towards
deducing from these data the actual elements; but he
found the mathematical difficulties too great to be overcome
except in some of the simpler cases, and it was
reserved for the next generation of mathematicians, notably
Lagrange, to shew the full power of the method.</p>

<p><a id="para_237"></a>237. <i>Joseph Louis Lagrange</i> was born at Turin in 1736,
when Clairaut was just starting for Lapland and D’Alembert
was still a child; he was descended from a French family
three generations of which had lived in Italy. He shewed
extraordinary mathematical talent, and when still a mere
boy was appointed professor at the Artillery School of his
native town, his pupils being older than himself. A few
years afterwards he was the chief mover in the foundation
of a scientific society, afterwards the Turin Academy of
Sciences, which published in 1759 its first volume of
Transactions, containing several mathematical articles by
Lagrange, which had been written during the last few
years. One of these<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> so impressed Euler, who had made
a special study of the subject dealt with, that he at once
obtained for Lagrange the honour of admission to the
Berlin Academy.</p>

<p>In 1764 Lagrange won the prize offered by the Paris
Academy for an essay on the libration of the moon. In
this essay he not only gave the first satisfactory, though
still incomplete, discussion of the librations (chapter vi.,
<a href="#para_133">§&nbsp;133</a>) of the moon due to the non-spherical forms of both
the earth and moon, but also introduced an extremely
general method of treating dynamical problems,<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> which
is the basis of nearly all the higher branches of dynamics
which have been developed up to the present day.</p>

<p>Two years later (1766) Frederick II., at the suggestion
of D’Alembert, asked Lagrange to succeed Euler (who
had just returned to St. Petersburg) as the head of the
mathematical section of the Berlin Academy, giving as a
reason that the greatest king in Europe wished to have
the greatest mathematician in Europe at his court.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
Lagrange accepted this magnificently expressed invitation
and spent the next 21 years at Berlin.</p>

<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 305.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p>During this period he produced an extraordinary series
of papers on astronomy, on general dynamics, and on a
variety of subjects in pure mathematics. Several of the
most important of the astronomical papers were sent to
Paris and obtained prizes offered by the Academy; most
of the other papers—about 60 in all—were published by
the Berlin Academy. During this period he wrote also
his great <i>Mécanique Analytique</i>, one of the most beautiful
of all mathematical books, in which he developed fully
the general dynamical ideas contained in the earlier paper
on libration. Curiously enough he had great difficulty in
finding a publisher for his masterpiece, and it only appeared
in 1788 in Paris. A year earlier he had left Berlin in
consequence of the death of Frederick, and accepted an
invitation from Louis XVI. to join the Paris Academy.
About this time he suffered from one of the fits of melancholy
with which he was periodically seized and which are
generally supposed to have been due to overwork during
his career at Turin. It is said that he never looked at
the <i>Mécanique Analytique</i> for two years after its publication,
and spent most of the time over chemistry and other
branches of natural science as well as in non-scientific
pursuits. In 1790 he was made president of the Commission
appointed to draw up a new system of weights
and measures, which resulted in the establishment of the
metric system; and the scientific work connected with this
undertaking gradually restored his interest in mathematics
and astronomy. He always avoided politics, and passed
through the Revolution uninjured, unlike his friend
Lavoisier the great chemist and Bailly the historian of
astronomy, both of whom were guillotined during the Terror.
He was in fact held in great honour by the various governments
which ruled France up to the time of his death;
in 1793 he was specially exempted from a decree of banishment
directed against all foreigners; subsequently he was
made professor of mathematics, first at the École Normale
(1795), the École Polytechnique (1797), the
last appointment being retained till his death in 1813.
During this period of his life he published, in addition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
to a large number of papers on astronomy and mathematics,
three important books on pure mathematics,<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> and at the
time of his death had not quite finished a second edition
of the <i>Mécanique Analytique</i>, the second volume appearing
posthumously.</p>

<p><a id="para_238"></a>238. <i>Pierre Simon Laplace</i>, the son of a small farmer,
was born at Beaumont in Normandy in 1749, being thus
13 years younger than his great rival Lagrange. Thanks
to the help of well-to-do neighbours, he was first a pupil
and afterwards a teacher at the Military School of his
native town. When he was 18 he went to Paris with a
letter of introduction to D’Alembert, and, when no notice
was taken of it, wrote him a letter on the principles of
mechanics which impressed D’Alembert so much that he
at once took interest in the young mathematician and
procured him an appointment at the Military School at
Paris. From this time onwards Laplace lived continuously
at Paris, holding various official positions. His first paper
(on pure mathematics) was published in the Transactions
of the Turin Academy for the years 1766-69, and from this
time to the end of his life he produced an uninterrupted
series of papers and books on astronomy and allied departments
of mathematics.</p>

<p>Laplace’s work on astronomy was to a great extent
incorporated in his <i>Mécanique Céleste</i>, the five volumes
of which appeared at intervals between 1799 and 1825.
In this great treatise he aimed at summing up all that had
been done in developing gravitational astronomy since the
time of Newton. The only other astronomical book which
he published was the <i>Exposition du Système du Monde</i>
(1796), one of the most perfect and charmingly written
popular treatises on astronomy ever published, in which
the great mathematician never uses either an algebraical
formula or a geometrical diagram. He published also in
1812 an elaborate treatise on the theory of probability or
chance,<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> on which nearly all later developments of the
subject have been based, and in 1819 a more popular
<i>Essai Philosophique</i> on the same subject.</p>

<p>Laplace’s personality seems to have been less attractive
than that of Lagrange. He was vain of his reputation as
a mathematician and not always generous to rival discoverers.
To Lagrange, however, he was always friendly,
and he was also kind in helping young mathematicians of
promise. While he was perfectly honest and courageous
in upholding his scientific and philosophical opinions, his
politics bore an undoubted resemblance to those of the
Vicar of Bray, and were professed by him with great
success. He was appointed a member of the Commission
for Weights and Measures, and afterwards of the Bureau des
Longitudes, and was made professor at the École Normale
when it was founded. When Napoleon became First
Consul, Laplace asked for and obtained the post of Home
Secretary, but—fortunately for science—was considered
quite incompetent, and had to retire after six weeks
(1799)<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>; as a compensation he was made a member of
the newly created Senate. The third volume of the
<i>Mécanique Céleste</i>, published in 1802, contained a dedication
to the “Heroic Pacificator of Europe,” at whose hand he
subsequently received various other distinctions, and by whom
he was created a Count when the Empire was formed. On
the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814 he tendered his
services to them, and was subsequently made a Marquis.
In 1816 he also received a very unusual honour for a
mathematician (shared, however, by D’Alembert) by being
elected one of the Forty “Immortals” of the <i>Académie
Française</i>; this distinction he seems to have owed in great
part to the literary excellence of the <i>Système du Monde</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these distractions he worked steadily
at mathematics and astronomy, and even after the completion
of the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i> wrote a supplement to it
which was published after his death (1827).</p>

<p>His last words, “<i>Ce que nous connaissons est peu de chose,
ce que nous ignorons est immense</i>,” coming as they did from
one who had added so much to knowledge, shew his
character in a pleasanter aspect than it sometimes presented
during his career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p><a id="para_239"></a>239. With the exception of Lagrange’s paper on libration,
nearly all his and Laplace’s important contributions to
astronomy were made when Clairaut’s and D’Alembert’s
work was nearly finished, though Euler’s activity continued
for nearly 20 years more. Lagrange, however,
survived him by 30 years and Laplace by more than 40; and
together they carried astronomical science to a far higher
stage of development than their three predecessors.</p>

<p><a id="para_240"></a>240. To the lunar theory Lagrange contributed comparatively
little except general methods, applicable to this
as to other problems of astronomy; but Laplace devoted
great attention to it. Of his special discoveries in the
subject the most notable was his explanation of the secular
acceleration of the moon’s mean motion (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_201">§&nbsp;201</a>),
which had puzzled so many astronomers. Lagrange had
attempted to explain it (1774), and had failed so completely
that he was inclined to discredit the early observations
on which the existence of the phenomenon was
based. Laplace, after trying ordinary methods without
success, attempted to explain it by supposing that gravitation
was an effect not transmitted instantaneously, but
that, like light, it took time to travel from the attracting
body to the attracted one; but this also failed. Finally
he traced it (1787) to an indirect planetary effect. For, as it
happens, certain perturbations which the moon experiences
owing to the action of the sun depend among other
things on the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit; this is one
of the elements (<a href="#para_236">§&nbsp;236</a>) which is being altered by the
action of the planets, and has for many centuries been very
slowly decreasing; the perturbation in question is therefore
being very slightly altered, and the moon’s average
rate of motion is in consequence very slowly increasing, or
the length of the month decreasing. The whole effect is
excessively minute, and only becomes perceptible in the
course of a long time. Laplace’s calculation shewed that
the moon would, in the course of a century, or in about
1,300 complete revolutions, gain about 10″ (more exactly
10″·2) owing to this cause, so that her place in the sky
would differ by that amount from what it would be if this
disturbing cause did not exist; in two centuries the angle
gained would be 40″, in three centuries 90″, and so on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
This may be otherwise expressed by saying that the length
of the month diminishes by about one-thirtieth of a second
in the course of a century. Moreover, as Laplace shewed
(<a href="#para_245">§&nbsp;245</a>), the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit will not go on
diminishing indefinitely, but after an immense period to be
reckoned in thousands of years will begin to increase, and
the moon’s motion will again become slower in consequence.</p>

<p>Laplace’s result agreed almost exactly with that indicated
by observation; and thus the last known discrepancy of
importance in the solar system between theory and observation
appeared to be explained away; and by a curious
coincidence this was effected just a hundred years after the
publication of the <i>Principia</i>.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards, however, Laplace’s explanation
was shewn to be far less complete than it appeared at the
time (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_287">§&nbsp;287</a>).</p>

<p>The same investigation revealed to Laplace the existence
of alterations of a similar character, and due to the same
cause, of other elements in the moon’s orbit, which, though
not previously noticed, were found to be indicated by
ancient eclipse observations.</p>

<p><a id="para_241"></a>241. The third volume of the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i> contains
a general treatment of the lunar theory, based on a
method entirely different from any that had been employed
before, and worked out in great detail. “My object,” says
Laplace, “in this book is to exhibit in the one law of
universal gravitation the source of all the inequalities of
the motion of the moon, and then to employ this law as
a means of discovery, to perfect the theory of this motion
and to deduce from it several important elements in the
system of the moon.” Laplace himself calculated no lunar
tables, but the Viennese astronomer <i>John Tobias Bürg</i>
(1766-1834) made considerable use of his formulae,
together with an immense number of Greenwich observations,
for the construction of lunar tables, which were sent
to the Institute of France in 1801 (before the publication
of Laplace’s complete lunar theory), and published in a
slightly amended form in 1806. A few years later (1812)
<i>John Charles Burckhardt</i> (1773-1825), a German who had
settled in Paris and worked under Laplace and Lalande,
produced a new set of tables based directly on the formulae<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
of the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i>. These were generally accepted
in lieu of Bürg’s, which had been in their turn an improvement
on Mason’s and Mayer’s.</p>

<p>Later work on lunar theory may conveniently be regarded
as belonging to a new period of astronomy (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>,
<a href="#para_286">§&nbsp;286</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_242"></a>242. Observation had shewn the existence of inequalities
in the planetary and lunar motions which seemed to
belong to two different classes. On the one hand were
inequalities, such as most of those of the moon, which went
through their cycle of changes in a single revolution or a
few revolutions of the disturbing body; and on the other
such inequalities as the secular acceleration of the moon’s
mean motion or the motion of the earth’s apses, in which
a continuous disturbance was observed always acting in the
same direction, and shewing no signs of going through a
periodic cycle of changes.</p>

<p>The mathematical treatment of perturbations soon shewed
the desirability of adopting different methods of treatment
for two classes of inequalities, which corresponded roughly,
though not exactly, to those just mentioned, and to which
the names of <b>periodic</b> and <b>secular</b> gradually came to be
attached. The distinction plays a considerable part in
Euler’s work (<a href="#para_236">§&nbsp;236</a>), but it was Lagrange who first
recognised its full importance, particularly for planetary
theory, and who made a special study of secular inequalities.</p>

<p>When the perturbations of one planet by another are
being studied, it becomes necessary to obtain a mathematical
expression for the disturbing force which the second planet
exerts. This expression depends in general both on the
elements of the two orbits, and on the positions of the
planets at the time considered. It can, however, be divided
up into two parts, one of which depends on the positions of the
planets (as well as on the elements), while the other depends
only on the elements of the two orbits, and is independent of
the positions in their paths which the planets may happen
to be occupying at the time. Since the positions of planets
in their orbits change rapidly, the former part of the
disturbing force changes rapidly, and produces in general,
at short intervals of time, effects in opposite directions, first,
for example, accelerating and then retarding the motion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
the disturbed planet; and the corresponding inequalities of
motion are the periodic inequalities, which for the most part
go through a complete cycle of changes in the course of a
few revolutions of the planets, or even more rapidly. The
other part of the disturbing force remains nearly unchanged
for a considerable period, and gives rise to changes in the
elements which, though in general very small, remain for a
long time without sensible alteration, and therefore continually
accumulate, becoming considerable with the lapse of
time: these are the secular inequalities.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, we may say that the periodical
inequalities are temporary and the secular inequalities
permanent in their effects, or as Sir John Herschel
expresses it:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The secular inequalities are, in fact, nothing but what remains
after the mutual destruction of a much larger amount (as it very
often is) of periodical. But these are in their nature transient and
temporary; they disappear in short periods, and leave no trace.
The planet is temporarily withdrawn from its orbit (its slowly
varying orbit), but forthwith returns to it, to deviate presently as
much the other way, while the varied orbit accommodates and
adjusts itself to the average of these excursions on either side
of it.”<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“Temporary” and “short” are, however, relative terms.
Some periodical inequalities, notably in the case of the
moon, have periods of only a few days, and the majority
which are of importance extend only over a few years; but
some are known which last for centuries or even thousands
of years, and can often be treated as secular when we only
want to consider an interval of a few years. On the other
hand, most of the known secular inequalities are not really
permanent, but fluctuate like the periodical ones, though
only in the course of immense periods of time to be reckoned
usually by tens of thousands of years.</p>

<p>One distinction between the lunar and planetary theories
is that in the former periodic inequalities are comparatively
large and, especially for practical purposes such as computing
the position of the moon a few months hence, of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
importance; whereas the periodic inequalities of the planets
are generally small and the secular inequalities are the most
interesting.</p>

<p>The method of treating the elements of the elliptic orbits
as variable is specially suitable for secular inequalities; but
for periodic inequalities it is generally better to treat the
body as being disturbed from an elliptic path, and to study
these deviations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The simplest way of regarding these various perturbations
consists in imagining a planet moving in accordance with the laws
of elliptic motion, on an ellipse the elements of which vary by
insensible degrees; and to conceive at the same time that the
true planet oscillates round this fictitious planet in a very small
orbit the nature of which depends on its periodic perturbations.”<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The former method, due as we have seen in great measure
to Euler, was perfected and very generally used by Lagrange,
and often bears his name.</p>

<p><a id="para_243"></a>243. It was at first naturally supposed that the slow
alteration in the rates of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn
(§§&nbsp;235, 236, and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_204">§&nbsp;204</a>) was a secular inequality;
Lagrange in 1766 made an attempt to explain it on this
basis which, though still unsuccessful, represented the
observations better than Euler’s work. Laplace in his first
paper on secular inequalities (1773) found by the use of
a more complete analysis that the secular alterations in
the rates of motions of Jupiter and Saturn appeared to
vanish entirely, and attempted to explain the motions by the
hypothesis, so often used by astronomers when in difficulties,
that a comet had been the cause.</p>

<p>In 1773 <i>John Henry Lambert</i> (1728-1777) discovered
from a study of observations that, whereas Halley had found
Saturn to be moving more slowly than in ancient times, it
was now moving faster than in Halley’s time—a conclusion
which pointed to a fluctuating or periodic cause of some
kind.</p>

<p>Finally in 1784 Laplace arrived at the true explanation.
Lagrange had observed in 1776 that if the times of revolution
of two planets are exactly proportional to two whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
numbers, then part of the periodic disturbing force produces
a secular change in their motions, acting continually in the
same direction; though he pointed out that such a case
did not occur in the solar system. If moreover the times
of revolution are <i>nearly</i> proportional to two whole numbers
(neither of which is very large), then part of the periodic
disturbing force produces an irregularity that is not strictly
secular, but has a very long period; and a disturbing force
so small as to be capable of being ordinarily overlooked
may, if it is of this kind, be capable of producing a considerable
effect.<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> Now Jupiter and Saturn revolve round
the sun in about 4,333 days and 10,759 days respectively; five
times the former number is 21,665, twice the latter is
21,518, which is very little less. Consequently the exceptional
case occurs; and on working it out Laplace found an
appreciable inequality with a period of about 900 years,
which explained the observations satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The inequalities of this class, of which several others have
been discovered, are known as <b>long inequalities</b>, and may
be regarded as connecting links between secular inequalities
and periodical inequalities of the usual kind.</p>

<p><a id="para_244"></a>244. The discovery that the observed inequality of
Jupiter and Saturn was not secular may be regarded as
the first step in a remarkable series of investigations on
secular inequalities carried out by Lagrange and Laplace,
for the most part between 1773 and 1784, leading to some
of the most interesting and general results in the whole of
gravitational astronomy. The two astronomers, though
living respectively in Berlin and Paris, were in constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
communication, and scarcely any important advance was
made by the one which was not at once utilised and
developed by the other.</p>

<p>The central problem was that of the secular alterations
in the elements of a planet’s orbit regarded as a varying
ellipse. Three of these elements, the axis of the ellipse,
its eccentricity, and the inclination of its plane to a fixed
plane (usually the ecliptic), are of much greater importance
than the other three. The first two are the elements on
which the size and shape of the orbit depend, and the first
also determines (by Kepler’s Third Law) the period of
revolution and average rate of motion of the planet;<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> the
third has an important influence on the mutual relations of
the two planets. The other three elements are chiefly of
importance for periodical inequalities.</p>

<p>It should be noted moreover that the eccentricities and
inclinations were in all cases (except those specially mentioned)
considered as small quantities; and thus all the
investigations were approximate, these quantities and the
disturbing forces themselves being treated as small.</p>

<p><a id="para_245"></a>245. The basis of the whole series of investigations was a
long paper published by Lagrange in 1766, in which he
explained the method of variation of elements, and gave
formulae connecting their rates of change with the disturbing
forces.</p>

<p>In his paper of 1773 Laplace found that what was true of
Jupiter and Saturn had a more general application, and
proved that in the case of any planet, disturbed by any
other, the axis was not only undergoing no secular change
at the present time, but could not have altered appreciably
since “the time when astronomy began to be cultivated.”</p>

<p>In the next year Lagrange obtained an expression for the
secular change in the inclination, <i>valid for all time</i>. When
this was applied to the case of Jupiter and Saturn, which on
account of their superiority in size and great distance from
the other planets could be reasonably treated as forming
with the sun a separate system, it appeared that the changes
in the inclinations would always be of a periodic nature, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
that they could never pass beyond certain fixed limits, not
differing much from the existing values. The like result
held for the system formed by the sun, Venus, the earth,
and Mars. Lagrange noticed moreover that there were
cases, which, as he said, fortunately did not appear to exist
in the system of the world, in which, on the contrary, the
inclinations might increase indefinitely. The distinction
depended on the masses of the bodies in question; and
although all the planetary masses were somewhat uncertain,
and those assumed by Lagrange for Venus and Mars almost
wholly conjectural, it did not appear that any reasonable
alteration in the estimated masses would affect the general
conclusion arrived at.</p>

<p>Two years later (1775) Laplace, much struck by the
method which Lagrange had used, applied it to the discussion
of the secular variations of the eccentricity, and
found that these were also of a periodic nature, so that the
eccentricity also could not increase or decrease indefinitely.</p>

<p>In the next year Lagrange, in a remarkable paper of
only 14 pages, proved that whether the eccentricities and
inclinations were treated as small or not, and whatever the
masses of the planets might be, the changes in the length of
the axis of any planetary orbit were necessarily all periodic,
so that for all time the length of the axis could only fluctuate
between certain definite limits. This result was, however,
still based on the assumption that the disturbing forces
could be treated as small.</p>

<p>Next came a series of five papers published between 1781
and 1784 in which Lagrange summed up his earlier work,
revised and improved his methods, and applied them to
periodical inequalities and to various other problems.</p>

<p>Lastly in 1784 Laplace, in the same paper in which he
explained the long inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, established
by an extremely simple method two remarkable
relations between the eccentricities and inclinations of the
planets, or any similar set of bodies.</p>

<p>The first relation is:—</p>

<p><i>If the mass of each planet be multiplied by the square root
of the axis of its orbit and by the square of the eccentricity,
then the sum of these products for all the planets is invariable
save for periodical inequalities.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>The second is precisely similar, save that eccentricity is
replaced by inclination.<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>The first of these propositions establishes the existence
of what may be called a stock or fund of eccentricity shared
by the planets of the solar system. If the eccentricity of
any one orbit increases, that of some other orbit must
undergo a corresponding decrease. Also the fund can
never be overdrawn. Moreover observation shews that the
eccentricities of all the planetary orbits are small; consequently
the whole fund is small, and the share owned at
any time by any one planet must be small.<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Consequently
the eccentricity of the orbit of a planet of which the mass
and distance from the sun are considerable can never
increase much, and a similar conclusion holds for the
inclinations of the various orbits.</p>

<p>One remarkable characteristic of the solar system is
presupposed in these two propositions; namely, that all the
planets revolve round the sun in the same direction, which
to an observer supposed to be on the north side of the
orbits appears to be contrary to that in which the hands
of a clock move. If any planet moved in the opposite
direction, the corresponding parts of the eccentricity and
inclination funds would have to be subtracted instead of
being added; and there would be nothing to prevent the
fund from being overdrawn.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar restriction is involved in Laplace’s
earlier results as to the impossibility of permanent changes
in the eccentricities, though a system might exist in which
his result would still be true if one or more of its members
revolved in a different direction from the rest, but in this
case there would have to be certain restrictions on the
proportions of the orbits not required in the other case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>Stated briefly, the results established by the two astronomers
were that the changes in axis, eccentricity, and
inclination of any planetary orbit are all permanently restricted
within certain definite limits. The perturbations
caused by the planets make all these quantities undergo
fluctuations of limited extent, some of which, caused by the
periodic disturbing forces, go through their changes in
comparatively short periods, while others, due to secular
forces, require vast intervals of time for their completion.</p>

<p>It may thus be said that the stability of the solar system
was established, as far as regards the particular astronomical
causes taken into account.</p>

<p>Moreover, if we take the case of the earth, as an inhabited
planet, any large alteration in the axis, that is in
the average distance from the sun, would produce a more
than proportional change in the amount of heat and light
received from the sun; any great increase in the eccentricity
would increase largely that part (at present very small) of
our seasonal variations of heat and cold which are due to
varying distance from the sun; while any change in position
of the ecliptic, which was unaccompanied by a corresponding
change of the equator, and had the effect of increasing the
angle between the two, would largely increase the variations of
temperature in the course of the year. The stability shewn
to exist is therefore a guarantee against certain kinds of
great climatic alterations which might seriously affect the
habitability of the earth.</p>

<p>It is perhaps just worth while to point out that the
results established by Lagrange and Laplace were mathematical
consequences, obtained by processes involving the
neglect of certain small quantities and therefore not perfectly
rigorous, of certain definite hypotheses to which the actual
conditions of the solar system bear a tolerably close resemblance.
Apart from causes at present unforeseen, it is
therefore not unreasonable to expect that for a very considerable
period of time the motions of the actual bodies
forming the solar system may be very nearly in accordance
with these results; but there is no valid reason why certain disturbing
causes, ignored or rejected by Laplace and Lagrange
on account of their insignificance, should not sooner or later
produce quite appreciable effects (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_293">§&nbsp;293</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p><a id="para_246"></a>246. A few of Laplace’s numerical results as to the secular
variations of the elements may serve to give an idea of
the magnitudes dealt with.</p>

<p>The line of apses of each planet moves in the same
direction; the most rapid motion, occurring in the case of
Saturn, amounted to about 15″ per annum, or rather less
than half a degree in a century. If this motion were to
continue uniformly, the line of apses would require no less
than 80,000 years to perform a complete circuit and return
to its original position. The motion of the line of nodes
(or line in which the plane of the planet’s orbit meets that
of the ecliptic) was in general found to be rather more
rapid. The annual alteration in the inclination of any orbit
to the ecliptic in no case exceeded a fraction of a second;
while the change of eccentricity of Saturn’s orbit, which
was considerably the largest, would, if continued for four
centuries, have only amounted to 1∕1000.</p>

<p><a id="para_247"></a>247. The theory of the secular inequalities has been
treated at some length on account of the general nature of
the results obtained. For the purpose of predicting the
places of the planets at moderate distances of time the
periodical inequalities are, however, of greater importance.
These were also discussed very fully both by Lagrange and
Laplace, the detailed working out in a form suitable for
numerical calculation being largely due to the latter. From
the formulæ given by Laplace and collected in the <i>Mécanique
Céleste</i> several sets of solar and planetary tables were
calculated, which were in general found to represent closely
the observed motions, and which superseded the earlier
tables based on less developed theories.<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p><a id="para_248"></a>248. In addition to the lunar and planetary theories
nearly all the minor problems of gravitational astronomy
were rediscussed by Laplace, in many cases with the aid
of methods due to Lagrange, and their solution was in all
cases advanced.</p>

<p>The theory of Jupiter’s satellites, which with Jupiter form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
a sort of miniature solar system but with several characteristic
peculiarities, was fully dealt with; the other satellites
received a less complete discussion. Some progress was
also made with the theory of Saturn’s ring by shewing that
it could not be a uniform solid body.</p>

<p>Precession and nutation were treated much more completely
than by D’Alembert; and the allied problems of
the irregularities in the rotation of the moon and of Saturn’s
ring were also dealt with.</p>

<p>The figure of the earth was considered in a much more
general way than by Clairaut, without, however, upsetting
the substantial accuracy of his conclusions; and the theory
of the tides was entirely reconstructed and greatly improved,
though a considerable gap between theory and observation
still remained.</p>

<p>The theory of perturbations was also modified so as to
be applicable to comets, and from observation of a comet
(known as Lexell’s) which had appeared in 1770 and was
found to have passed close to Jupiter in 1767 it was inferred
that its orbit had been completely changed by the attraction
of Jupiter, but that, on the other hand, it was incapable of
exercising any appreciable disturbing influence on Jupiter
or its satellites.</p>

<p>As, on the one hand, the complete calculation of the
perturbations of the various bodies of the solar system
presupposes a knowledge of their masses, so reciprocally
if the magnitudes of these disturbances can be obtained
from observation they can be used to determine or to
correct the values of the several masses. In this way the
masses of Mars and of Jupiter’s satellites, as well as of
Venus (<a href="#para_235">§&nbsp;235</a>), were estimated, and those of the moon and
the other planets revised. In the case of Mercury, however,
no perturbation of any other planet by it could be satisfactorily
observed, and—except that it was known to be small—its
mass remained for a long time a matter of conjecture.
It was only some years after Laplace’s death that the effect
produced by it on a comet enabled its mass to be estimated
(1842), and the mass is even now very uncertain.</p>

<p><a id="para_249"></a>249. By the work of the great mathematical astronomers
of the 18th century, the results of which were summarised
in the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i>, it was shewn to be possible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
account for the observed motions of the bodies of the solar
system with a tolerable degree of accuracy by means of the
law of gravitation.</p>

<p>Newton’s problem (<a href="#para_228">§&nbsp;228</a>) was therefore approximately
solved, and the agreement between theory and observation
was in most cases close enough for the practical purpose
of predicting for a moderate time the places of the various
celestial bodies. The outstanding discrepancies between
theory and observation were for the most part so small as
compared with those that had already been removed as to
leave an almost universal conviction that they were capable
of explanation as due to errors of observation, to want
of exactness in calculation, or to some similar cause.</p>

<p><a id="para_250"></a>250. Outside the circle of professed astronomers and
mathematicians Laplace is best known, not as the author of
the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i>, but as the inventor of the <b>Nebular
Hypothesis</b>.</p>

<p>This famous speculation was published (in 1796) in his
popular book the <i>Système du Monde</i> already mentioned,
and was almost certainly independent of a somewhat similar
but less detailed theory which had been suggested by the
philosopher <i>Immanuel Kant</i> in 1755.</p>

<p>Laplace was struck with certain remarkable characteristics
of the solar system. The seven planets known to him when
he wrote revolved round the sun in the same direction, the
fourteen satellites revolved round their primaries still in
the same direction,<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and such motions of rotation of sun,
planets, and satellites about their axes as were known
followed the same law. There were thus some 30 or 40
motions all in the same direction. If these motions of the
several bodies were regarded as the result of chance and
were independent of one another, this uniformity would be
a coincidence of a most extraordinary character, as unlikely
as that a coin when tossed the like number of times should
invariably come down with the same face uppermost.</p>

<p>These motions of rotation and revolution were moreover
all in planes but slightly inclined to one another; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
eccentricities of all the orbits were quite small, so that
they were nearly circular.</p>

<p>Comets, on the other hand, presented none of these peculiarities;
their paths were very eccentric, they were inclined
at all angles to the ecliptic, and were described in either
direction.</p>

<p>Moreover there were no known bodies forming a connecting
link in these respects between comets and planets
or satellites.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>From these remarkable coincidences Laplace inferred
that the various bodies of the solar system must have had
some common origin. The hypothesis which he suggested
was that they had condensed out of a body that might
be regarded either as the sun with a vast atmosphere filling
the space now occupied by the solar system, or as a fluid
mass with a more or less condensed central part or nucleus;
while at an earlier stage the central condensation might have
been almost non-existent.</p>

<p>Observations of Herschel’s (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_259">§§&nbsp;259-61</a>) had
recently revealed the existence of many hundreds of bodies
known as nebulae, presenting very nearly such appearances
as might have been expected from Laplace’s primitive body.
The differences in structure which they shewed, some being
apparently almost structureless masses of some extremely
diffused substance, while others shewed decided signs of
central condensation, and others again looked like ordinary
stars with a slight atmosphere round them, were also
strongly suggestive of successive stages in some process
of condensation.</p>

<p>Laplace’s suggestion then was that the solar system had
been formed by condensation out of a nebula; and a
similar explanation would apply to the fixed stars, with the
planets (if any) which surrounded them.</p>

<p>He then sketched, in a somewhat imaginative way, the
process whereby a nebula, if once endowed with a rotatory
motion, might, as it condensed, throw off a series of rings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
and each of these might in turn condense into a planet with
or without satellites; and gave on this hypothesis plausible
reasons for many of the peculiarities of the solar system.</p>

<p>So little is, however, known of the behaviour of a body
like Laplace’s nebula when condensing and rotating that it
is hardly worth while to consider the details of the scheme.</p>

<p>That Laplace himself, who has never been accused of
underrating the importance of his own discoveries, did not
take the details of his hypothesis nearly as seriously as
many of its expounders, may be inferred both from the fact
that he only published it in a popular book, and from his
remarkable description of it as “these conjectures on the
formation of the stars and of the solar system, conjectures
which I present with all the distrust (<i>défiance</i>) which everything
which is not a result of observation or of calculation
ought to inspire.”<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<span class="smcap">Herschel’s</span> <i>Epitaph</i>.</p>


<p><a id="para_251"></a>251. <i>Frederick William Herschel</i> was born at Hanover on
November 15th, 1738, two years after Lagrange and nine
years before Laplace. His father was a musician in the
Hanoverian army, and the son, who shewed a remarkable
aptitude for music as well as a decided taste for knowledge
of various sorts, entered his father’s profession as a boy (1753).
On the breaking out of the Seven Years’ War he served
during part of a campaign, but his health being delicate his
parents “determined to remove him from the service—a
step attended by no small difficulties,” and he was accordingly
sent to England (1757), to seek his fortune as a
musician.</p>

<p>After some years spent in various parts of the country, he
moved (1766) to Bath, then one of the great centres of
fashion in England. At first oboist in Linley’s orchestra,
then organist of the Octagon Chapel, he rapidly rose to
a position of great popularity and distinction, both as a
musician and as a music-teacher. He played, conducted,
and composed, and his private pupils increased so rapidly
that the number of lessons which he gave was at one time
35 a week. But this activity by no means exhausted
his extraordinary energy; he had never lost his taste for
study, and, according to a contemporary biographer, “after
a fatiguing day of 14 or 16 hours spent in his vocation, he
would retire at night with the greatest avidity to <i>unbend the
mind</i>, if it may be so called, with a few propositions in
Maclaurin’s Fluxions, or other books of that sort.” His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
musical studies had long ago given him an interest in
mathematics, and it seems likely that the study of Robert
Smith’s <i>Harmonics</i> led him to the <i>Compleat System of Optics</i>
of the same author, and so to an interest in the construction
and use of telescopes. The astronomy that he read soon
gave him a desire to see for himself what the books described;
first he hired a small reflecting telescope, then
thought of buying a larger instrument, but found that the
price was prohibitive. Thus he was gradually led to attempt
the construction of his own telescopes (1773). His brother
Alexander, for whom he had found musical work at Bath,
and who seems to have had considerable mechanical talent
but none of William’s perseverance, helped him in this
undertaking, while his devoted sister <i>Caroline</i> (1750-1848),
who had been brought over to England by William in
1772, not only kept house, but rendered a multitude of
minor services. The operation of grinding and polishing
the mirror for a telescope was one of the greatest delicacy,
and at a certain stage required continuous labour for
several hours. On one occasion Herschel’s hand never left
the polishing tool for 16 hours, so that “by way of keeping
him alive” Caroline was “obliged to feed him by putting
the victuals by bits into his mouth,” and in less extreme
cases she helped to make the operation less tedious by
reading aloud: it is with some feeling of relief that we hear
that on these occasions the books read were not on mathematics,
optics, or astronomy, but were such as <i>Don
Quixote</i>, the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, and the novels of Sterne and
Fielding.</p>

<p><a id="para_252"></a>252. After an immense number of failures Herschel
succeeded in constructing a tolerable reflecting telescope—soon
to be followed by others of greater size and perfection—and
with this he made his first recorded observation, of
the Orion nebula, in March 1774.</p>

<p>This observation, made when he was in his 36th year,
may be conveniently regarded as the beginning of his
astronomical career, though for several years more music
remained his profession, and astronomy could only be
cultivated in such leisure time as he could find or make
for himself; his biographers give vivid pictures of his
extraordinary activity during this period, and of his zeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
in using odd fragments of time, such as intervals between
the acts at a theatre, for his beloved telescopes.</p>

<p>A letter written by him in 1783 gives a good account of
the spirit in which he was at this time carrying out his
astronomical work:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I determined to accept nothing on faith, but to see with my
own eyes what others had seen before me.... I finally succeeded
in completing a so-called Newtonian instrument, 7 feet
in length. From this I advanced to one of 10 feet, and at last
to one of 20, for I had fully made up my mind to carry on
the improvement of my telescopes as far as it could possibly be
done. When I had carefully and thoroughly perfected the great
instrument in all its parts, I made systematic use of it in my
observations of the heavens, first forming a determination never
to pass by any, the smallest, portion of them without due
investigation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In accordance with this last resolution he executed on
four separate occasions, beginning in 1775, each time with
an instrument of greater power than on the preceding, a
review of the whole heavens, in which everything that
appeared in any way remarkable was noticed and if necessary
more carefully studied. He was thus applying to
astronomy methods comparable with those of the naturalist
who aims at drawing up a complete list of the flora or
fauna of a country hitherto little known</p>

<p><a id="para_253"></a>253. In the course of the second of these reviews, made
with a telescope of the Newtonian type, 7 feet in length,
he made the discovery (March 13th, 1781) which gave him
a European reputation and enabled him to abandon music
as a profession and to devote the whole of his energies
to science.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In examining the small stars in the neighbourhood of
η <i>Geminorum</i> I perceived one that appeared visibly larger
than the rest; being struck with its uncommon appearance I
compared it to η <i>Geminorum</i> and the small star in the quartile
between <i>Auriga</i> and <i>Gemini</i> and finding it so much larger than
either of them, I suspected it to be a comet.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If Herschel’s suspicion had been correct the discovery
would have been of far less interest than it actually was,
for when the new body was further observed and attempts
were made to calculate its path, it was found that no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
ordinary cometary orbit would in any way fit its motion,
and within three or four months of its discovery it was
recognised—first by <i>Anders Johann Lexell</i> (1740-1784)—as
being no comet but a new planet, revolving round the
sun in a nearly circular path, at a distance about 19 times
that of the earth and nearly double that of Saturn.</p>

<p>No new planet had been discovered in historic times, and
Herschel’s achievement was therefore absolutely unique;
even the discovery of satellites inaugurated by Galilei
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_121">§&nbsp;121</a>) had come to a stop nearly a century
before (1684), when Cassini had detected his second pair
of satellites of Saturn (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_160">§&nbsp;160</a>). Herschel
wished to exercise the discoverer’s right of christening by
calling the new planet after his royal patron <i>Georgium Sidus</i>,
but though the name was used for some time in England,
Continental astronomers never accepted it, and after an
unsuccessful attempt to call the new body <i>Herschel</i>, it was
generally agreed to give a name similar to those of the
other planets, and <i>Uranus</i> was proposed and accepted.</p>

<p>Although by this time Herschel had published two or
three scientific papers and was probably known to a slight
extent in English scientific circles, the complete obscurity
among Continental astronomers of the author of this memorable
discovery is curiously illustrated by a discussion in
the leading astronomical journal (Bode’s <i>Astronomisches
Jahrbuch</i>) as to the way to spell his name, <i>Hertschel</i> being
perhaps the best and <i>Mersthel</i> the worst of several attempts.</p>

<p><a id="para_254"></a>254. This obscurity was naturally dissipated by the discovery
of Uranus. Distinguished visitors to Bath, among
them the Astronomer Royal Maskelyne (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_219">§&nbsp;219</a>),
sought his acquaintance; before the end of the year he
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, in addition to
receiving one of its medals, and in the following spring he
was summoned to Court to exhibit himself, his telescopes,
and his stars to George III. and to various members of the
royal family. As the outcome of this visit he received
from the King an appointment as royal astronomer, with
a salary of £200 a year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="HERSCHEL"></a>
<img src="images/i_p326b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">WILLIAM HERSCHEL.
<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 327.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p>With this appointment his career as a musician came
to an end, and in August 1782 the brother and sister left
Bath for good, and settled first in a dilapidated house at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
Datchet, then, after a few months (1785-6) spent at Clay
Hall in Old Windsor, at Slough in a house now known
as Observatory House and memorable in Arago’s words as
“le lieu du monde où il a été fait le plus de découvertes.”</p>

<p><a id="para_255"></a>255. Herschel’s modest salary, though it would have
sufficed for his own and his sister’s personal wants, was of
course insufficient to meet the various expenses involved in
making and mounting telescopes. The skill which he had
now acquired in the art was, however, such that his telescopes
were far superior to any others which were available, and
as his methods were his own, there was a considerable
demand for instruments made by him. Even while at
Bath he had made and sold a number, and for years after
moving to the neighbourhood of Windsor he derived a
considerable income from this source, the royal family and
a number of distinguished British and foreign astronomers
being among his customers.</p>

<p>The necessity for employing his valuable time in this
way fortunately came to an end in 1788, when he married
a lady with a considerable fortune; Caroline lived henceforward
in lodgings close to her brother, but worked for
him with unabated zeal.</p>

<p>By the end of 1783 Herschel had finished a telescope
20 feet in length with a great mirror 18 inches in diameter,
and with this instrument most of his best work was done;
but he was not yet satisfied that he had reached the limit
of what was possible. During the last winter at Bath he
and his brother had spent a great deal of labour in an
unsuccessful attempt to construct a 30-foot telescope; the
discovery of Uranus and its consequences prevented the
renewal of the attempt for some time, but in 1785 he began
a 40-foot telescope with a mirror four feet in diameter, the
expenses of which were defrayed by a special grant from
the King. While it was being made Herschel tried a new
form of construction of reflecting telescopes, suggested by
Lemaire in 1732 but never used, by which a considerable
gain of brilliancy was effected, but at the cost of some loss
of distinctness. This <b>Herschelian</b> or <b>front-view</b> construction,
as it is called, was first tried with the 20-foot, and led
to the discovery (January 11th, 1787) of two satellites of
Uranus, <i>Oberon</i> and <i>Titania</i>; it was henceforward regularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
employed. After several mishaps the 40-foot telescope
(fig. 82) was successfully constructed. On the first evening
on which it was employed (August 28th, 1789) a sixth satellite
of Saturn (<i>Enceladus</i>) was detected, and on September 17th a
much fainter seventh satellite (<i>Mimas</i>). Both satellites were
found to be nearer to the planet than any of the five hitherto
discovered, Mimas being the nearer of the two (cf. fig. 91).</p>

<p>Although for the detection of extremely faint objects such
as these satellites the great telescope was unequalled, for
many kinds of work and for all but the very clearest
evenings a smaller instrument was as good, and being less
unwieldy was much more used. The mirror of the great
telescope deteriorated to some extent, and after 1811,
Herschel’s hand being then no longer equal to the delicate
task of repolishing it, the telescope ceased to be used
though it was left standing till 1839, when it was dismounted
and closed up.</p>

<p><a id="para_256"></a>256. From the time of his establishment at Slough till
he began to lose his powers through old age the story of
Herschel’s life is little but a record of the work he did. It
was his practice to employ in observing the whole of
every suitable night; his daylight hours were devoted to
interpreting his observations and to writing the papers in
which he embodied his results. His sister was nearly
always present as his assistant when he was observing, and
also did a good deal of cataloguing, indexing, and similar
work for him. After leaving Bath she also did some
observing on her own account, though only when her
brother was away or for some other reason did not require
her services; she specialised on comets, and succeeded from
first to last in discovering no less than eight. To form any
adequate idea of the discomfort and even danger attending
the nights spent in observing, it is necessary to realise that
the great telescopes used were erected in the open air,
that for both the Newtonian and Herschelian forms of
reflectors the observer has to be near the upper end of the
telescope, and therefore at a considerable height above
the ground. In the 40-foot, for example, ladders 50 feet
in length were used to reach the platform on which the
observer was stationed. Moreover from the nature of
the case satisfactory observations could not be taken in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
presence either of the moon or of artificial light. It is
not therefore surprising that Caroline Herschel’s journals
contain a good many expressions of anxiety for her brother’s
welfare on these occasions, and it is perhaps rather a matter
of wonder that so few serious accidents occurred.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span>—Herschel’s forty-foot telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>In addition to doing his real work Herschel had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
receive a large number of visitors who came to Slough out
of curiosity or genuine scientific interest to see the great
man and his wonderful telescopes. In 1801 he went to
Paris, where he made Laplace’s acquaintance and also saw
Napoleon, whose astronomical knowledge he rated much
below that of George III., while “his general air was
something like affecting to know more than he did know.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1807 he had a serious illness; and from
that time onwards his health remained delicate, and a
larger proportion of his time was in consequence given to
indoor work. The last of the great series of papers
presented to the Royal Society appeared in 1818, when he
was almost 80, though three years later he communicated
a list of double stars to the newly founded Royal Astronomical
Society. His last observation was taken almost at
the same time, and he died rather more than a year afterwards
(August 21st, 1822), when he was nearly 84.</p>

<p>He left one son, John, who became an astronomer only
less distinguished than his father (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_306">§§&nbsp;306-8</a>).
Caroline Herschel after her beloved brother’s death returned
to Hanover, chiefly to be near other members of her family;
here she executed one important piece of work by cataloguing
in a convenient form her brother’s lists of nebulae, and for
the remaining 26 years of her long life her chief interest
seems to have been in the prosperous astronomical career
of her nephew John.</p>

<p><a id="para_257"></a>257. The incidental references to Herschel’s work that
have been made in describing his career have shewn him
chiefly as the constructor of giant telescopes far surpassing
in power any that had hitherto been used, and as the
diligent and careful observer of whatever could be seen
with them in the skies. Sun and moon, planets and fixed
stars, were all passed in review, and their peculiarities noted
and described. But this merely descriptive work was in
Herschel’s eyes for the most part means to an end, for, as
he said in 1811, “a knowledge of the construction of the
heavens has always been the ultimate object of my
observations.”</p>

<p>Astronomy had for many centuries been concerned almost
wholly with the positions of the various heavenly bodies
on the celestial sphere, that is with their directions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Coppernicus and his successors had found that the apparent
motions on the celestial sphere of the members of the solar
system could only be satisfactorily explained by taking
into account their actual motions in space, so that the
solar system came to be effectively regarded as consisting
of bodies at different distances from the earth and separated
from one another by so many miles. But with the fixed
stars the case was quite different: for, with the unimportant
exception of the proper motions of a few stars (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>,
<a href="#para_203">§&nbsp;203</a>), all their known apparent motions were explicable as
the result of the motion of the earth; and the relative or actual
distances of the stars scarcely entered into consideration.
Although the belief in a real celestial sphere to which the
stars were attached scarcely survived the onslaughts of
Tycho Brahe and Galilei, and any astronomer of note
in the latter part of the 17th or in the 18th century would,
if asked, have unhesitatingly declared the stars to be at
different distances from the earth, this was in effect a
mere pious opinion which had no appreciable effect on
astronomical work.</p>

<p>The geometrical conception of the stars as represented
by points on a celestial sphere was in fact sufficient for
ordinary astronomical purposes, and the attention of great
observing astronomers such as Flamsteed, Bradley, and
Lacaille was directed almost entirely towards ascertaining
the positions of these points with the utmost accuracy or
towards observing the motions of the solar system. Moreover
the group of problems which Newton’s work suggested
naturally concentrated the attention of eighteenth-century
astronomers on the solar system, though even from this
point of view the construction of star catalogues had considerable
value as providing reference points which could
be used for fixing the positions of the members of the solar
system.</p>

<p>Almost the only exception to this general tendency
consisted in the attempts—hitherto unsuccessful—to find
the parallaxes and hence the distances of some of the
fixed stars, a problem which, though originally suggested
by the Coppernican controversy, had been recognised as
possessing great intrinsic interest.</p>

<p>Herschel therefore struck out an entirely new path when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
he began to study the sidereal system <i>per se</i> and the
mutual relations of its members. From this point of view
the sun, with its attendant planets, became one of an
innumerable host of stars, which happened to have received
a fictitious importance from the accident that we inhabited
one member of its system.</p>

<p><a id="para_258"></a>258. A complete knowledge of the positions in space
of the stars would of course follow from the measurement
of the parallax (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, §&nbsp;129 and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_207">§&nbsp;207</a>) of
each. The failure of such astronomers as Bradley to get the
parallax of any one star was enough to shew the hopelessness
of this general undertaking, and, although Herschel did make
an attack on the parallax problem (<a href="#para_263">§&nbsp;263</a>), he saw that the
question of stellar distribution in space, if to be answered
at all, required some simpler if less reliable method capable
of application on a large scale.</p>

<p>Accordingly he devised (1784) his method of <b>star-gauging</b>.
The most superficial view of the sky shews that
the stars visible to the naked eye are very unequally distributed
on the celestial sphere; the same is true when
the fainter stars visible in a telescope are taken into account.
If two portions of the sky of the same apparent or angular
magnitude are compared, it may be found that the first
contains many times as many stars as the second. If we
realise that the stars are not actually on a sphere but are
scattered through space at different distances from us,
we can explain this inequality of distribution on the <i>sky</i>
as due to either a real inequality of distribution in <i>space</i>,
or to a difference in the distance to which the sidereal
system extends in the directions in which the two sets of
stars lie. The first region on the sky may correspond to
a region of space in which the stars are really clustered
together, or may represent a direction in which the sidereal
system extends to a greater distance, so that the accumulation
of layer after layer of stars lying behind one another
produces the apparent density of distribution. In the same
way, if we are standing in a wood and the wood appears
less thick in one direction than in another, it may be
because the trees are really more thinly planted there or
because in that direction the edge of the wood is nearer.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span>—Section of the sidereal system. From Herschel’s paper in
the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>In the absence of any <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the actual
clustering of the stars in space, Herschel chose the former
of these two hypotheses; that is, he treated the apparent
density of the stars on any particular part of the sky as
a measure of the depth to which the sidereal systems
extended in that direction, and interpreted from this point
of view the results of a vast series of observations. He
used a 20-foot telescope so arranged that he could see
with it a circular portion of the sky 15′ in diameter (one-quarter
the area of the sun or full moon), turned the telescope
to different parts of the sky, and counted the stars visible
in each case. To avoid accidental irregularities he usually
took the average of several neighbouring fields, and published
in 1785 the results of gauges thus made in 683<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> regions,
while he subsequently added 400 others which he did not
think it necessary to publish. Whereas in some parts of
the sky he could see on an average only one star at a time,
in others nearly 600 were visible, and he estimated that
on one occasion about 116,000 stars passed through the
field of view of his telescope in a quarter of an hour.
The general result was, as rough naked-eye observation
suggests, that stars are most plentiful in and near the
Milky Way and least so in the parts of the sky most remote
from it. Now the Milky Way forms on the sky an ill-defined
band never deviating much from a great circle
(sometimes called the <b>galactic</b> circle); so that on Herschel’s
hypothesis the space occupied by the stars is shaped
roughly like a disc or grindstone, of which according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
his figures the diameter is about five times the thickness.
Further, the Milky Way is during part of its length divided
into two branches, the space between the two branches
being comparatively free of stars. Corresponding to this
subdivision there has therefore to be assumed a cleft in
the “grindstone.”</p>

<p>This “grindstone” theory of the universe had been
suggested in 1750 by <i>Thomas Wright</i> (1711-1786) in his
<i>Theory of the Universe</i>, and again by Kant five years later;
but neither had attempted, like Herschel, to collect numerical
data and to work out consistently and in detail the consequences
of the fundamental hypothesis.</p>

<p>That the assumption of uniform distribution of stars in
space could not be true in detail was evident to Herschel
from the beginning. A star cluster, for example, in which
many thousands of faint stars are collected together in a
very small space on the sky, would have to be interpreted
as representing a long projection or spike full of stars,
extending far beyond the limits of the adjoining portions of
the sidereal system, and pointing directly away from the
position occupied by the solar system. In the same way
certain regions in the sky which are found to be bare of
stars would have to be regarded as tunnels through the
stellar system. That even one or two such spikes or tunnels
should exist would be improbable enough, but as star
clusters were known in considerable numbers before Herschel
began his work, and were discovered by him in
hundreds, it was impossible to explain their existence on
this hypothesis, and it became necessary to assume that a
star cluster occupied a region of space in which stars were
really closer together than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Moreover further study of the arrangement of the stars,
particularly of those in the Milky Way, led Herschel gradually
to the belief that his original assumption was a wider
departure from the truth than he had at first supposed;
and in 1811, nearly 30 years after he had begun star-gauging,
he admitted a definite change of opinion:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“I must freely confess that by continuing my sweeps of the
heavens my opinion of the arrangement of the stars ... has
undergone a gradual change.... For instance, an equal scattering
of the stars may be admitted in certain calculations; but when
we examine the Milky Way, or the closely compressed clusters
of stars of which my catalogues have recorded so many instances,
this supposed equality of scattering must be given up.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The method of star-gauging was intended primarily to give
information as to the limits of the sidereal system—or the
visible portions of it. Side by side with this method Herschel
constantly made use of the brightness of a star as a probable
test of nearness. If two stars give out actually the same
amount of light, then that one which is nearer to us will
appear the brighter; and on the assumption that no light
is absorbed or stopped in its passage through space, the
apparent brightness of the two stars will be inversely as the
<i>square</i> of their respective distances. Hence, if we receive
nine times as much light from one star as from another,
and if it is assumed that this difference is merely due to
difference of distance, then the first star is three times as
far off as the second, and so on.</p>

<p>That the stars as a whole give out the same amount of
light, so that the difference in their apparent brightness is
due to distance only, is an assumption of the same general
character as that of equal distribution. There must necessarily
be many exceptions, but, in default of more exact
knowledge, it affords a rough-and-ready method of estimating
with some degree of probability relative distances of stars.</p>

<p>To apply this method it was necessary to have some
means of comparing the amount of light received from
different stars. This Herschel effected by using telescopes of
different sizes. If the same star is observed with two reflecting
telescopes of the same construction but of different
sizes, then the light transmitted by the telescope to the eye
is proportional to the area of the mirror which collects the
light, and hence to the square of the diameter of the mirror.
Hence the apparent brightness of a star as viewed through
a telescope is proportional on the one hand to the inverse
square of the distance, and on the other to the square of
the diameter of the mirror of the telescope; hence the
distance of the star is, as it were, exactly counterbalanced by
the diameter of the mirror of the telescope. For example,
if one star viewed in a telescope with an eight-inch mirror
and another viewed in the great telescope with a four-foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
mirror appear equally bright, then the second star is—on
the fundamental assumption—six times as far off.</p>

<p>In the same way the size of the mirror necessary to make
a star just visible was used by Herschel as a measure of
the distance of the star, and it was in this sense that he
constantly referred to the “space-penetrating power” of his
telescope. On this assumption he estimated the faintest
stars visible to the naked eye to be about twelve times as
remote as one of the brightest stars, such as Arcturus, while
Arcturus if removed to 900 times its present distance would
just be visible in the 20-foot telescope which he commonly
used, and the 40-foot would penetrate about twice as far
into space.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his life (1817) Herschel made an
attempt to compare statistically his two assumptions of
uniform distribution in space and of uniform actual brightness,
by counting the number of stars of each degree of
apparent brightness and comparing them with the numbers
that would result from uniform distribution in space if
apparent brightness depended only on distance. The
inquiry only extended as far as stars visible to the naked
eye and to the brighter of the telescopic stars, and indicated
the existence of an excess of the fainter stars of these
classes, so that either these stars are more closely packed
in space than the brighter ones, or they are in reality smaller
or less luminous than the others; but no definite conclusions
as to the arrangement of the stars were drawn.</p>

<p><a id="para_259"></a>259. Intimately connected with the structure of the sidereal
system was the question of the distribution and nature of
<b>nebulae</b> (cf. figs. 100, 102, facing pp. 397, 400) and <b>star
clusters</b> (cf. fig. 104, facing p. 405). When Herschel began
his work rather more than 100 such bodies were known,
which had been discovered for the most part by the French
observers Lacaille (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_223">§&nbsp;223</a>) and <i>Charles Messier</i>
(1730-1817). Messier may be said to have been a comet-hunter
by profession; finding himself liable to mistake
nebulae for comets, he put on record (1781) the positions
of 103 of the former. Herschel’s discoveries—carried out
much more systematically and with more powerful instrumental
appliances—were on a far larger scale. In 1786
he presented to the Royal Society a catalogue of 1,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
new nebulae and clusters, three years later a second catalogue
of the same extent, and in 1802 a third comprising
500. Each nebula was carefully observed, its general
appearance as well as its position being noted and described,
and to obtain a general idea of the distribution of nebulae
on the sky the positions were marked on a star map.
The differences in brightness and in apparent structure led
to a division into eight classes; and at quite an early stage
of his work (1786) he gave a graphic account of the extraordinary
varieties in form which he had noted:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have seen double and treble nebulae, variously arranged;
large ones with small, seeming attendants; narrow but much
extended, lucid nebulae or bright dashes; some of the shape
of a fan, resembling an electric brush, issuing from a lucid
point; others of the cometic shape, with a seeming nucleus
in the center; or like cloudy stars, surrounded with a nebulous
atmosphere; a different sort again contain a nebulosity of the
milky kind, like that wonderful inexplicable phenomenon about
θ Orionis; while others shine with a fainter mottled kind
of light, which denotes their being resolvable into stars.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_260"></a>260. But much the most interesting problem in classification
was that of the relation between nebulae and star clusters.
The Pleiades, for example, appear to ordinary eyes as a
group of six stars close together, but many short-sighted
people only see there a portion of the sky which is a little
brighter than the adjacent region; again, the nebulous
patch of light, as it appears to the ordinary eye, known as
<i>Praesepe</i> (in the Crab), is resolved by the smallest telescope
into a cluster of faint stars. In the same way there are
other objects which in a small telescope appear cloudy or
nebulous, but viewed in an instrument of greater power are
seen to be star clusters. In particular Herschel found that
many objects which to Messier were purely nebulous
appeared in his own great telescopes to be undoubted
clusters, though others still remained nebulous. Thus in
his own words:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nebulae can be selected so that an insensible gradation
shall take place from a coarse cluster like the Pleiades down
to a milky nebulosity like that in Orion, every intermediate step
being represented.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>These facts suggested obviously the inference that the
difference between nebulae and star clusters was merely a
question of the power of the telescope employed, and accordingly
Herschel’s next sentence is:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This tends to confirm the hypothesis that all are composed
of stars more or less remote.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea was not new, having at any rate been suggested,
rather on speculative than on scientific grounds, in 1755
by Kant, who had further suggested that a single nebula
or star cluster is an assemblage of stars comparable in
magnitude and structure with the whole of those which
constitute the Milky Way and the other separate stars which
we see. From this point of view the sun is one star in a
cluster, and every nebula which we see is a system of the
same order. This “island universe” theory of nebulae, as
it has been called, was also at first accepted by Herschel,
so that he was able once to tell Miss Burney that he had
discovered 1,500 new universes.</p>

<p>Herschel, however, was one of those investigators who
hold theories lightly, and as early as 1791 further observation
had convinced him that these views were untenable,
and that some nebulae at least were essentially distinct from
star clusters. The particular object which he quotes in
support of his change of view was a certain nebulous star—that
is, a body resembling an ordinary star but surrounded
by a circular halo gradually diminishing in brightness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Cast your eye,” he says, “on this cloudy star, and the
result will be no less decisive.... Your judgement, I may
venture to say, will be, that the <i>nebulosity about the star is not
of a starry nature</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If the nebulosity were due to an aggregate of stars so
far off as to be separately indistinguishable, then the central
body would have to be a star of almost incomparably greater
dimensions than an ordinary star; if, on the other hand,
the central body were of dimensions comparable with those
of an ordinary star, the nebulosity must be due to something
other than a star cluster. In either case the object
presented features markedly different from those of a star
cluster of the recognised kind; and of the two alternative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
explanations Herschel chose the latter, considering the
nebulosity to be “a shining fluid, of a nature totally unknown
to us.” One exception to his earlier views being
thus admitted, others naturally followed by analogy, and
henceforward he recognised nebulae of the “shining fluid”
class as essentially different from star clusters, though it
might be impossible in many cases to say to which class
a particular body belonged.</p>

<p>The evidence accumulated by Herschel as to the distribution
of nebulae also shewed that, whatever their nature,
they could not be independent of the general sidereal
system, as on the “island universe” theory. In the first
place observation soon shewed him that an individual nebula
or cluster was usually surrounded by a region of the sky
comparatively free from stars; this was so commonly the
case that it became his habit while sweeping for nebulae,
after such a bare region had passed through the field of
his telescope, to warn his sister to be ready to take down
observations of nebulae. Moreover, as the position of a
large number of nebulae came to be known and charted,
it was seen that, whereas clusters were common near the
Milky Way, nebulae which appeared incapable of resolution
into clusters were scarce there, and shewed on the contrary
a decided tendency to be crowded together in the regions
of the sky most remote from the Milky Way—that is, round
the poles of the galactic circle (<a href="#para_258">§&nbsp;258</a>). If nebulae were
external systems, there would of course be no reason why
their distribution on the sky should shew any connection
either with the scarcity of stars generally or with the position
of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>It is, however, rather remarkable that Herschel did not
in this respect fully appreciate the consequences of his
own observations, and up to the end of his life seems
to have considered that some nebulae and clusters were
external “universes,” though many were part of our own
system.</p>

<p><a id="para_261"></a>261. As early as 1789 Herschel had thrown out the
idea that the different kinds of nebulae and clusters were
objects of the same kind at different stages of development,
some “clustering power” being at work converting
a diffused nebula into a brighter and more condensed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
body; so that condensation could be regarded as a sign
of “age.” And he goes on:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This method of viewing the heavens seems to throw them
into a new kind of light. They are now seen to resemble a luxuriant
garden, which contains the greatest variety of productions, in
different flourishing beds; and one advantage we may at least
reap from it is, that we can, as it were, extend the range of
our experience to an immense duration. For, to continue the
simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom, is it not
almost the same thing, whether we live successively to witness
the germination, blooming, foliage, fecundity, fading, withering
and corruption of a plant, or whether a vast number of
specimens, selected from every stage through which the plant
passes in the course of its existence, be brought at once to
our view?”</p></blockquote>

<p>His change of opinion in 1791 as to the nature of nebulae
led to a corresponding modification of his views of this
process of condensation. Of the star already referred to
(<a href="#para_260">§&nbsp;260</a>) he remarked that its nebulous envelope “was more
fit to produce a star by its condensation than to depend upon
the star for its existence.” In 1811 and 1814 he published
a complete theory of a possible process whereby the shining
fluid constituting a diffused nebula might gradually condense—the
denser portions of it being centres of attraction—first
into a denser nebula or compressed star cluster, then
into one or more nebulous stars, lastly into a single star
or group of stars. Every supposed stage in this process
was abundantly illustrated from the records of actual nebulae
and clusters which he had observed.</p>

<p>In the latter paper he also for the first time recognised
that the clusters in and near the Milky Way really belonged
to it, and were not independent systems that happened to
lie in the same direction as seen by us.</p>

<p><a id="para_262"></a>262. On another allied point Herschel also changed his
mind towards the end of his life. When he first used his
great 20-foot telescope to explore the Milky Way, he thought
that he had succeeded in completely resolving its faint
cloudy light into component stars, and had thus penetrated
to the end of the Milky Way; but afterwards he was convinced
that this was not the case, but that there remained
cloudy portions which—whether on account of their remote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>ness
or for other reasons—his telescopes were unable to
resolve into stars (cf. fig. 104, facing p. 405).</p>

<p>In both these respects therefore the structure of the
Milky Way appeared to him finally less simple than at
first.</p>

<p><a id="para_263"></a>263. One of the most notable of Herschel’s discoveries
was a bye-product of an inquiry of an entirely different
character. Just as Bradley in trying to find the parallax of
a star discovered aberration and nutation (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_207">§&nbsp;207</a>),
so also the same problem in Herschel’s hands led to the
discovery of double stars. He proposed to employ Galilei’s
differential or double-star method (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_129">§&nbsp;129</a>), in
which the minute shift of a star’s position, due to the earth’s
motion round the sun, is to be detected not by measuring
its angular distance from standard points on the celestial
sphere such as the pole or the zenith, but by observing the
variations in its distance from some star close to it, which
from its faintness or for some other reason might be
supposed much further off and therefore less affected by
the earth’s motion.</p>

<p>With this object in view Herschel set to work to find
pairs of stars close enough together to be suitable for his
purpose, and, with his usual eagerness to see and to record
all that could be seen, gathered in an extensive harvest
of such objects. The limit of distance between the two
members of a pair beyond which he did not think it worth
while to go was 2′, an interval imperceptible to the naked
eye except in cases of quite abnormally acute sight. In
other words, the two stars—even if bright enough to be
visible—would always appear as <i>one</i> to the ordinary eye.
A first catalogue of such pairs, each forming what may
be called a <b>double star</b>, was published early in 1782 and
contained 269, of which 227 were new discoveries; a second
catalogue of 434 was presented to the Royal Society at the
end of 1784; and his last paper, sent to the Royal Astronomical
Society in 1821 and published in the first volume
of its memoirs, contained a list of 145 more. In addition to
the position of each double star the angular distance between
the two members, the direction of the line joining them,
and the brightness of each were noted. In some cases also
curious contrasts in the colour of the two components were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
observed. There were also not a few cases in which not
merely two, but three, four, or more stars were found close
enough to one another to be reckoned as forming a multiple
star.</p>

<p>Herschel had begun with the idea that a double star
was due to a merely accidental coincidence in the direction
of two stars which had no connection with one another and
one of which might be many times as remote as the other.
It had, however, been pointed out by Michell (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>,
<a href="#para_219">§&nbsp;219</a>), as early as 1767, that even the few double stars
then known afforded examples of coincidences which were
very improbable as the result of mere random distribution
of stars. A special case may be taken to make the argument
clearer, though Michell’s actual reasoning was not
put into a numerical form. The bright star Castor (in the
Twins) had for some time been known to consist of two
stars, α and β, rather less than 5″ apart. Altogether there
are about 50 stars of the same order of brightness as α, and
400 like β. Neither set of stars shews any particular
tendency to be distributed in any special way over the
celestial sphere. So that the question of probabilities
becomes: if there are 50 stars of one sort and 400 of another
distributed at random over the whole celestial sphere, the
two distributions having no connection with one another,
what is the chance that one of the first set of stars should
be within 5″ of one of the second set? The chance is
about the same as that, if 50 grains of wheat and 400 of
barley are scattered at random in a field of 100 acres, one
grain of wheat should be found within half an inch of a
grain of barley. The odds against such a possibility are
clearly very great and can be shewn to be more than
300,000 to one. These are the odds against the existence—without
some real connection between the members—of
a <i>single</i> double star like Castor; but when Herschel began
to discover double stars by the hundred the improbability
was enormously increased. In his first paper Herschel
gave as his opinion that “it is much too soon to form any
theories of small stars revolving round large ones,” a remark
shewing that the idea had been considered; and in 1784
Michell returned to the subject, and expressed the opinion
that the odds in favour of a physical relation between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
members of Herschel’s newly discovered double stars were
“beyond arithmetic.”</p>

<p><a id="para_264"></a>264. Twenty years after the publication of his first
catalogue Herschel was of Michell’s opinion, but was
now able to support it by evidence of an entirely novel
and much more direct character. A series of observations
of Castor, presented in two papers published in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> in 1803 and 1804, which were fortunately
supplemented by an observation of Bradley’s in
1759, had shewn a progressive alteration in the direction
of the line joining its two components, of such a character
as to leave no doubt that the two stars were revolving
round one another; and there were five other cases in
which a similar motion was observed. In these six cases
it was thus shewn that the double star was really formed by
a connected pair of stars near enough to influence one
another’s motion. A double star of this kind is called a
<b>binary star</b> or a <b>physical double star</b>, as distinguished from
a merely optical double star, the two members of which have
no connection with one another. In three cases, including
Castor, the observations were enough to enable the period
of a complete revolution of one star round another, assumed
to go on at a uniform rate, to be at any rate roughly
estimated, the results given by Herschel being 342 years
for Castor,<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> 375 and 1,200 years for the other two. It was
an obvious inference that the motion of revolution observed
in a binary star was due to the mutual gravitation of its
members, though Herschel’s data were not enough to
determine with any precision the law of the motion, and
it was not till five years after his death that the first attempt
was made to shew that the orbit of a binary star was such
as would follow from, or at any rate would be consistent
with, the mutual gravitation of its members (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>,
§&nbsp;309: cf. also fig. 101). This may be regarded as the first
direct evidence of the extension of the law of gravitation to
regions outside the solar system.</p>

<p>Although only a few double stars were thus definitely
shewn to be binary, there was no reason why many others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
should not be so also, their motion not having been rapid
enough to be clearly noticeable during the quarter of a
century or so over which Herschel’s observations extended;
and this probability entirely destroyed the utility of double
stars for the particular purpose for which Herschel had
originally sought them. For if a double star is binary,
then the two members are approximately at the same
distance from the earth and therefore equally affected by
the earth’s motion, whereas for the purpose of finding the
parallax it is essential that one should be much more
remote than the other. But the discovery which he had
made appeared to him far more interesting than that which
he had attempted but failed to make; in his own picturesque
language, he had, like Saul, gone out to seek his father’s
asses and had found a kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="para_265"></a>265. It had been known since Halley’s time (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>,
<a href="#para_203">§&nbsp;203</a>) that certain stars had proper motions on the celestial
sphere, relative to the general body of stars. The conviction,
that had been gradually strengthening among astronomers,
that the sun is only one of the fixed stars, suggested the
possibility that the sun, like other stars, might have a
motion in space. Thomas Wright, Lambert, and others
had speculated on the subject, and Tobias Mayer (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>,
§§&nbsp;225-6) had shewn how to look for such a motion.</p>

<p>If a single star appears to move, then by the principle of
relative motion (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span>, <a href="#para_77">§&nbsp;77</a>) this may be explained
equally well by a motion of the star or by a motion of the
observer, or by a combination of the two; and since in this
problem the internal motions of the solar system may be
ignored, this motion of the observer may be identified with
that of the sun. When the proper motions of several stars
are observed, a motion of the sun only is in general inadequate
to explain them, but they may be regarded as due
either solely to the motions in space of the stars or to
combinations of these with some motion of the sun. If
now the stars be regarded as motionless and the sun be
moving towards a particular point on the celestial sphere,
then by an obvious effect of perspective the stars near
that point will appear to recede from it and one another
on the celestial sphere, while those in the opposite region
will approach one another, the magnitude of these changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
depending on the rapidity of the sun’s motion and on
the nearness of the stars in question. The effect is exactly
of the same nature as that produced when, on looking
along a street at night, two lamps on opposite sides of the
street at some distance from us appear close together, but
as we walk down the street towards them they appear to
become more and more separated from one another. In
the figure, for example, <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">L′</span> as seen from <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> appear
farther apart than when seen from <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span>—Illustrating the effect of the sun’s motion in space.</div>
</div>

<p>If the observed proper motions of stars examined are not
of this character, they cannot be explained as due <i>merely</i> to
the motion of the sun; but if they shew some tendency
to move in this way, then the observations can be most
simply explained by regarding the sun as in motion, and
by assuming that the discrepancies between the effects
resulting from the assumed motion of the sun and the
observed proper motions are due to the motions in space
of the several stars.</p>

<p>From the few proper motions which Mayer had at his
command he was, however, unable to derive any indication
of a motion of the sun.</p>

<p>Herschel used the proper motions, published by Maskelyne
and Lalande, of 14 stars (13 if the double star Castor be
counted as only one), and with extraordinary insight detected
in them a certain uniformity of motion of the kind already
described, such as would result from a motion of the sun.
The point on the celestial sphere towards which the sun
was assumed to be moving, the <b>apex</b> as he called it, was
taken to be the point marked by the star λ in the constella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>tion
Hercules. A motion of the sun in this direction
would, he found, produce in the 14 stars apparent motions
which were in the majority of cases in general agreement
with those observed.<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> This result was published in 1783,
and a few months later <i>Pierre Prévost</i> (1751-1839) deduced
a very similar result from Tobias Mayer’s collection of
proper motions. More than 20 years later (1805) Herschel
took up the question again, using six of the brightest stars
in a collection of the proper motions of 36 published by
Maskelyne in 1790, which were much more reliable than
any earlier ones, and employing more elaborate processes
of calculation; again the apex was placed in the constellation
Hercules, though at a distance of nearly 30° from the
position given in 1783. Herschel’s results were avowedly
to a large extent speculative, and were received by contemporary
astronomers with a large measure of distrust;
but a number of far more elaborate modern investigations
of the same subject have confirmed the general correctness
of his work, the earlier of his two estimates appearing,
however, to be the more accurate. He also made some
attempts in the same papers and in a third (published in
1806) to estimate the speed as well as the direction of the
sun’s motion; but the work necessarily involved so many
assumptions as to the probable distances of the stars—which
were quite unknown—that it is not worth while to
quote results more definite than the statement made in
the paper of 1783, that “We may in a general way estimate
that the solar motion can certainly not be less than that
which the earth has in her annual orbit.”</p>

<p><a id="para_266"></a>266. The question of the comparative brightness of stars
was, as we have seen (<a href="#para_258">§&nbsp;258</a>), of importance in connection
with Herschel’s attempts to estimate their relative distances
from the earth and their arrangement in space; it also
presented itself in connection with inquiries into the variability
of the light of stars. Two remarkable cases of
variability had been for some time known. A star in the
Whale (ο <i>Ceti</i> or <i>Mira</i>) had been found to be at times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
invisible to the naked eye and at other times to be conspicuous;
a Dutch astronomer, <i>Phocylides Holwarda</i> (1618-1651),
first clearly recognised its variable character (1639),
and <i>Ismael Boulliau</i> or <i>Bullialdus</i> (1605-1694) in 1667 fixed
its period at about eleven months, though it was found that
its fluctuations were irregular both in amount and in period.
Its variations formed the subject of the first paper published
by Herschel in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> (1780). An
equally remarkable variable star is that known as <i>Algol</i>
(or β <i>Persei</i>), the fluctuations of which were found to be
performed with almost absolute regularity. Its variability
had been noted by <i>Geminiano Montanari</i> (1632-1687) in
1669, but the regularity of its changes was first detected
in 1783 by <i>John Goodricke</i> (1764-1786), who was soon
able to fix its period at very nearly 2 days 20 hours 49
minutes. Algol, when faintest, gives about one-quarter as
much light as when brightest, the change from the first
state to the second being effected in about ten hours;
whereas Mira varies its light several hundredfold, but
accomplishes its changes much more slowly.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Herschel’s career these and three or
four others of less interest were the only stars definitely
recognised as variable, though a few others were added soon
afterwards. Several records also existed of so-called “new”
stars, which had suddenly been noticed in places where no
star had previously been observed, and which for the most
part rapidly became inconspicuous again (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, §&nbsp;42;
chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>, §&nbsp;100; chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_138">§&nbsp;138</a>); such stars might
evidently be regarded as variable stars, the times of greatest
brightness occurring quite irregularly or at long intervals.
Moreover various records of the brightness of stars by earlier
astronomers left little doubt that a good many must have
varied sensibly in brightness. For example, a small star in
the Great Bear (close to the middle star of the “tail”) was
among the Arabs a noted test of keen sight, but is perfectly
visible even in our duller climate to persons with ordinary
eyesight; and Castor, which appeared the brighter of the
two Twins to Bayer when he published his Atlas (1603),
was in the 18th century (as now) less bright than Pollux.</p>

<p>Herschel made a good many definite measurements of
the amounts of light emitted by stars of various magnitudes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
but was not able to carry out any extensive or systematic
measurements on this plan. With a view to the future
detection of such changes of brightness as have just been
mentioned, he devised and carried out on a large scale
the extremely simple method of <b>sequences</b>. If a group of
stars are observed and their order of brightness noted at
two different times, then any alteration in the order will
shew that the brightness of one or more has changed. So
that if a number of stars are observed in sets in such a way
that each star is recorded as being less bright than certain
stars near it and brighter than certain other stars, materials
are thereby provided for detecting at any future time any
marked amount of variation of brightness. Herschel prepared
on this plan, at various times between 1796 and 1799,
four catalogues of comparative brightness based on naked-eye
observations and comprising altogether about 3,000
stars. In the course of the work a good many cases of
slight variability were noticed; but the most interesting
discovery of this kind was that of the variability of the
well-known star α <i>Herculis</i>, announced in 1796. The period
was estimated at 60 days, and the star thus seemed to form
a connecting link between the known variables which like
Algol had periods of a very few days and those (of which
Mira was the best known) with periods of some hundreds
of days. As usual, Herschel was not content with a mere
record of observations, but attempted to explain the observed
facts by the supposition that a variable star had a rotation
and that its surface was of unequal brightness.</p>

<p><a id="para_267"></a>267. The novelty of Herschel’s work on the fixed stars,
and the very general character of the results obtained, have
caused this part of his researches to overshadow in some
respects his other contributions to astronomy.</p>

<p>Though it was no part of his plan to contribute to that
precise knowledge of the motions of the bodies of the solar
system which absorbed the best energies of most of the
astronomers of the 18th century—whether they were
observers or mathematicians—he was a careful and successful
observer of the bodies themselves.</p>

<p>His discoveries of Uranus, of two of its satellites, and of
two new satellites of Saturn have been already mentioned
in connection with his life (§§&nbsp;253, 255). He believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
himself to have seen also (1798) four other satellites of
Uranus, but their existence was never satisfactorily verified;
and the second pair of satellites now known to belong to
Uranus, which were discovered by Lassell in 1847 (chapter
<span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_295">§&nbsp;295</a>), do not agree in position and motion with
any of Herschel’s four. It is therefore highly probable that
they were mere optical illusions due to defects of his mirror,
though it is not impossible that he may have caught glimpses
of one or other of Lassell’s satellites and misinterpreted the
observations.</p>

<p>Saturn was a favourite object of study with Herschel from
the very beginning of his astronomical career, and seven
papers on the subject were published by him between 1790
and 1806. He noticed and measured the deviation of the
planet’s form from a sphere (1790); he observed various
markings on the surface of the planet itself, and seems to
have seen the inner ring, now known from its appearance
as the crape ring (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_295">§&nbsp;295</a>), though he did not
recognise its nature. By observations of some markings at
some distance from the equator he discovered (1790) that
Saturn rotated on an axis, and fixed the period of rotation
at about 10 h. 16 m. (a period differing only by about 2
minutes from modern estimates), and by similar observations
of the ring (1790) concluded that it rotated in about 10-1∕2
hours, the axis of rotation being in each case perpendicular
to the plane of the ring. The satellite Japetus, discovered
by Cassini in 1671 (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_160">§&nbsp;160</a>), had long been
recognised as variable in brightness, the light emitted being
several times as much at one time as at another. Herschel
found that these variations were not only perfectly regular,
but recurred at an interval equal to that of the satellite’s
period of rotation round its primary (1792), a conclusion
which Cassini had thought of but rejected as inconsistent
with his observations. This peculiarity was obviously capable
of being explained by supposing that different portions of
Japetus had unequal power of reflecting light, and that like our
moon it turned on its axis once in every revolution, in such
a way as always to present the same face towards its
primary, and in consequence each face in turn to an
observer on the earth. It was natural to conjecture that
such an arrangement was general among satellites, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
Herschel obtained (1797) some evidence of variability in
the satellites of Jupiter, which appeared to him to support
this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Herschel’s observations of other planets were less
numerous and important. He rightly rejected the supposed
observations by Schroeter (<a href="#para_271">§&nbsp;271</a>) of vast mountains on
Venus, and was only able to detect some indistinct markings
from which the planet’s rotation on an axis could be
somewhat doubtfully inferred. He frequently observed the
familiar bright bands on Jupiter commonly called belts,
which he was the first to interpret (1793) as bands of
cloud. On Mars he noted the periodic diminution of the
white caps on the two poles, and observed how in these
and other respects Mars was of all planets the one most
like the earth.</p>

<p><a id="para_268"></a>268. Herschel made also a number of careful observations
on the sun, and based on them a famous theory of its
structure. He confirmed the existence of various features
of the solar surface which had been noted by the earlier
telescopists such as Galilei, Scheiner, and Hevel, and
added to them in some points of detail. Since Galilei’s
time a good many suggestions as to the nature of spots had
been thrown out by various observers, such as that they
were clouds, mountain-tops, volcanic products, etc., but
none of these had been supported by any serious evidence.
Herschel’s observations of the appearances of spots suggested
to him that they were depressions in the surface of the sun,
a view which derived support from occasional observations
of a spot when passing over the edge of the sun as a
distinct depression or notch there. Upon this somewhat
slender basis of fact he constructed (1795) an elaborate
theory of the nature of the sun, which attracted very general
notice by its ingenuity and picturesqueness and commanded
general assent in the astronomical world for more than half
a century. The interior of the sun was supposed to be a
cold dark solid body, surrounded by two cloud-layers, of
which the outer was the <b>photosphere</b> or ordinary surface of
the sun, intensely hot and luminous, and the inner served as
a fire-screen to protect the interior. The umbra (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>,
<a href="#para_124">§&nbsp;124</a>) of a spot was the dark interior seen through an
opening in the clouds, and the penumbra corresponded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
to the inner cloud-layer rendered luminous by light from
above.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The sun viewed in this light appears to be nothing else
than a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, evidently the first
or, in strictness of speaking, the only primary one of our
system; ... it is most probably also inhabited, like the rest
of the planets, by beings whose organs are adapted to the
peculiar circumstances of that vast globe.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That spots were depressions had been suggested more
than twenty years before (1774) by <i>Alexander Wilson</i> of
Glasgow (1714-1786), and supported by evidence different
from any adduced by Herschel and in some ways more
conclusive. Wilson noticed, first in the case of a large
spot seen in 1769, and afterwards in other cases, that as
the sun’s rotation carries a spot across its disc from one
edge to another, its appearance changes exactly as it would
do in accordance with ordinary laws of perspective if the
spot were a saucer-shaped depression, of which the bottom
formed the umbra and the sloping sides the penumbra,
since the penumbra appears narrowest on the side nearest
the centre of the sun and widest on the side nearest the
edge. Hence Wilson inferred, like Herschel, but with
less confidence, that the body of the sun is dark. In
the paper referred to Herschel shews no signs of being
acquainted with Wilson’s work, but in a second paper
(1801), which contained also a valuable series of observations
of the detailed markings on the solar surface, he
refers to Wilson’s “geometrical proof” of the depression
of the umbra of a spot.</p>

<p>Although it is easy to see now that Herschel’s theory was
a rash generalisation from slight data, it nevertheless explained—with
fair success—most of the observations made
up to that time.</p>

<p>Modern knowledge of heat, which was not accessible
to Herschel, shews us the fundamental impossibility of
the continued existence cf a body with a cold interior and
merely a shallow ring of hot and luminous material round
it; and the theory in this form is therefore purely of
historic interest (cf. also chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XIII.</span>, <a href="#para_298">§§&nbsp;298</a>, 303).</p>

<p><a id="para_269"></a>269. Another suggestive idea of Herschel’s was the
analogy between the sun and a variable star, the known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
variation in the number of spots and possibly of other
markings on the sun suggesting to him the probability
of a certain variability in the total amount of solar light
and heat emitted. The terrestrial influence of this he
tried to measure—in the absence of precise meteorological
data—with characteristic ingenuity by the price of
wheat, and some evidence was adduced to shew that at
times when sun-spots had been noted to be scarce—corresponding
according to Herschel’s view to periods
of diminished solar activity—wheat had been dear and
the weather presumably colder. In reality, however,
the data were insufficient to establish any definite conclusions.</p>

<p><a id="para_270"></a>270. In addition to carrying out the astronomical researches
already sketched, and a few others of less importance,
Herschel spent some time, chiefly towards the end of
his life, in working at light and heat; but the results obtained,
though of considerable value, belong rather to physics than
to astronomy, and need not be dealt with here.</p>

<p><a id="para_271"></a>271. It is natural to associate Herschel’s wonderful series
of discoveries with his possession of telescopes of unusual
power and with his formulation of a new programme of
astronomical inquiry; and these were certainly essential
elements. It is, however, significant, as shewing how important
other considerations were, that though a great
number of his telescopes were supplied to other astronomers,
and though his astronomical programme when
once suggested was open to all the world to adopt, hardly
any of his contemporaries executed any considerable
amount of work comparable in scope to his own.</p>

<p>Almost the only astronomer of the period whose work
deserves mention beside Herschel’s, though very inferior to
it both in extent and in originality, was <i>Johann Hieronymus
Schroeter</i> (1745-1816).</p>

<p>Holding an official position at Lilienthal, near Bremen,
he devoted his leisure during some thirty years to a scrutiny
of the planets and of the moon, and to a lesser extent of
other bodies.</p>

<p>As has been seen in the case of Venus (<a href="#para_267">§&nbsp;267</a>), his results
were not always reliable, but notwithstanding some errors
he added considerably to our knowledge of the appearances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
presented by the various planets, and in particular studied
the visible features of the moon with a minuteness and
accuracy far exceeding that of any of his predecessors, and
made some attempt to deduce from his observations data
as to its physical condition. His two volumes on the
moon (<i>Selenotopographische Fragmente</i>, 1791 and 1802), and
other minor writings, are a storehouse of valuable detail,
to which later workers have been largely indebted.</p>

<p><a id="para_272"></a>272. The last three chapters have contained some account
of progress made in three branches of astronomy which,
though they overlap and exercise an important influence on
one another, are to a large extent studied by different men
and by different methods, and have different aims. The
difference is perhaps best realised by thinking of the work
of a great master in each department, Bradley, Laplace,
and Herschel. So great is the difference that Delambre
in his standard history of astronomy all but ignores the
work of the great school of mathematical astronomers who
were his contemporaries and immediate predecessors, not
from any want of appreciation of their importance, but
because he regards their work as belonging rather to mathematics
than to astronomy; while Bessel (<a href="#para_277">§&nbsp;277</a>), in saying
that the function of astronomy is “to assign the places on
the sky where sun, moon, planets, comets, and stars have
been, are, and will be,” excludes from its scope nearly
everything towards which Herschel’s energies were directed.</p>

<p>Current modern practice is, however, more liberal in its
use of language than either Delambre or Bessel, and finds it
convenient to recognise all three of the subjects or groups
of subjects referred to as integral parts of one science.</p>

<p>The mutual relation of gravitational astronomy and what
has been for convenience called observational astronomy
has been already referred to (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_196">§&nbsp;196</a>). It should,
however, be noticed that the latter term has in this book
hitherto been used chiefly for only one part of the astrono<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>mical
work which concerns itself primarily with observation.
Observing played at least as large a part in Herschel’s
work as in Bradley’s, but the aims of the two men were
in many ways different. Bradley was interested chiefly in
ascertaining as accurately as possible the apparent positions
of the fixed stars on the celestial sphere, and the positions
and motions of the bodies of the solar system, the former
undertaking being in great part subsidiary to the latter.
Herschel, on the other hand, though certain of his researches,
<i>e.g.</i> into the parallax of the fixed stars and into
the motions of the satellites of Uranus, were precisely like
some of Bradley’s, was far more concerned with questions
of the appearances, mutual relations, and structure of the
celestial bodies in themselves. This latter branch of
astronomy may conveniently be called <b>descriptive astronomy</b>,
though the name is not altogether appropriate to inquiries
into the physical structure and chemical constitution of
celestial bodies which are often put under this head, and
which play an important part in the astronomy of the
present day.</p>

<p><a id="para_273"></a>273. Gravitational astronomy and exact observational
astronomy have made steady progress during the nineteenth
century, but neither has been revolutionised, and the
advances made have been to a great extent of such a
nature as to be barely intelligible, still less interesting, to
those who are not experts. The account of them to be
given in this chapter must therefore necessarily be of the
slightest character, and deal either with general tendencies or
with isolated results of a less technical character than the rest.</p>

<p>Descriptive astronomy, on the other hand, which can be
regarded as being almost as much the creation of Herschel
as gravitational astronomy is of Newton, has not only been
greatly developed on the lines laid down by its founder, but
has received—chiefly through the invention of spectrum
analysis (<a href="#para_299">§&nbsp;299</a>)—extensions into regions not only unthought
of but barely imaginable a century ago. Most of the
results of descriptive astronomy—unlike those of the older
branches of the subject—are readily intelligible and fairly
interesting to those who have but little knowledge of the
subject; in particular they are as yet to a considerable
extent independent of the mathematical ideas and language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
which dominate so much of astronomy and render it
unattractive or inaccessible to many. Moreover, not only
can descriptive astronomy be appreciated and studied, but
its progress can materially be assisted, by observers who
have neither knowledge of higher mathematics nor any
elaborate instrumental equipment.</p>

<p>Accordingly, while the successors of Laplace and Bradley
have been for the most part astronomers by profession,
attached to public observatories or to universities, an
immense mass of valuable descriptive work has been done
by amateurs who, like Herschel in the earlier part of his
career, have had to devote a large part of their energies to
professional work of other kinds, and who, though in some
cases provided with the best of instruments, have in many
others been furnished with only a slender instrumental
outfit. For these and other reasons one of the most
notable features of nineteenth century astronomy has been
a great development, particularly in this country and in the
United States, of general interest in the subject, and the
establishment of a large number of private observatories
devoted almost entirely to the study of special branches of
descriptive astronomy. The nineteenth century has accordingly
witnessed the acquisition of an unprecedented
amount of detailed astronomical knowledge. But the
wealth of material thus accumulated has outrun our powers
of interpretation, and in a number of cases our knowledge
of some particular department of descriptive astronomy
consists, on the one hand of an immense series of careful
observations, and on the other of one or more highly
speculative theories, seldom capable of explaining more
than a small portion of the observed facts.</p>

<p>In dealing with the progress of modern descriptive
astronomy the proverbial difficulty of seeing the wood on
account of the trees is therefore unusually great. To give
an account within the limits of a single chapter of even the
most important facts added to our knowledge would be a
hopeless endeavour; fortunately it would also be superfluous,
as they are to be found in many easily accessible textbooks
on astronomy, or in treatises on special parts of the subject.
All that can be attempted is to give some account of the
chief lines on which progress has been made, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
indicate some general conclusions which seem to be
established on a tolerably secure basis.</p>

<p><a id="para_274"></a>274. The progress of exact observation has of course
been based very largely on instrumental advances. Not
only have great improvements been made in the extremely
delicate work of making large lenses, but the graduated
circles and other parts of the mounting of a telescope
upon which accuracy of measurement depends can also be
constructed with far greater exactitude and certainty than
at the beginning of the century. New methods of mounting
telescopes and of making and recording observations have
also been introduced, all contributing to greater accuracy.
For certain special problems photography is found to
present great advantages as compared with eye-observations,
though its most important applications have so far been to
descriptive astronomy.</p>

<p><a id="para_275"></a>275. The necessity for making allowance for various
known sources of errors in observation, and for diminishing
as far as possible the effect of errors due to unknown causes,
had been recognised even by Tycho Brahe (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span>,
<a href="#para_110">§&nbsp;110</a>), and had played an important part in the work
of Flamsteed and Bradley (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_198">§§&nbsp;198</a>, 218).
Some further important steps in this direction were taken
in the earlier part of this century. The method of
<b>least squares</b>, established independently by two great
mathematicians, <i>Adrien Marie Legendre</i> (1752-1833) of
Paris and <i>Carl Friedrich Gauss</i> (1777-1855) of Göttingen,<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>
was a systematic method of combining observations,
which gave slightly different results, in such a way
as to be as near the truth as possible. Any ordinary
physical measurement, <i>e.g.</i> of a length, however carefully
executed, is necessarily imperfect; if the same measurement
is made several times, even under almost identical conditions,
the results will in general differ slightly; and the
question arises of combining these so as to get the most
satisfactory result. The common practice in this simple
case has long been to take the arithmetical mean or average
of the different results. But astronomers have constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
to deal with more complicated cases in which <i>two</i> or more
unknown quantities have to be determined from observations
of different quantities, as, for example, when the
elements of the orbit of a planet (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_236">§&nbsp;236</a>) have
to be found from observations of the planet’s position at
different times. The method of least squares gives a rule
for dealing with such cases, which was a generalisation
of the ordinary rule of averages for the case of a single
unknown quantity; and it was elaborated in such a way
as to provide for combining observations of different value,
such as observations taken by observers of unequal skill
or with different instruments, or under more or less favourable
conditions as to weather, etc. It also gives a simple
means of testing, by means of their mutual consistency,
the value of a series of observations, and comparing their
probable accuracy with that of some other series executed
under different conditions. The method of least squares
and the special case of the “average” can be deduced
from a certain assumption as to the general character of
the causes which produce the error in question; but the
assumption itself cannot be justified <i>a priori</i>; on the other
hand, the satisfactory results obtained from the application
of the rule to a great variety of problems in astronomy
and in physics has shewn that in a large number of cases
unknown causes of error must be approximately of the
type considered. The method is therefore very widely
used in astronomy and physics wherever it is worth
while to take trouble to secure the utmost attainable
accuracy.</p>

<p><a id="para_276"></a>276. Legendre’s other contributions to science were
almost entirely to branches of mathematics scarcely affecting
astronomy. Gauss, on the other hand, was for nearly
half a century head of the observatory of Göttingen, and
though his most brilliant and important work was in pure
mathematics, while he carried out some researches of first-rate
importance in magnetism and other branches of physics,
he also made some further contributions of importance to
astronomy. These were for the most part processes of
calculation of various kinds required for utilising astronomical
observations, the best known being a method of
calculating the orbit of a planet from three complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
observations of its position, which was published in his
<i>Theoria Motus</i> (1809). As we have seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>,
(<a href="#para_236">§&nbsp;236</a>), the complete determination of a planet’s orbit
depends on six independent elements: any complete observation
of the planet’s position in the sky, at any time,
gives two quantities, <i>e.g.</i> the right ascension and declination
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>, <a href="#para_33">§&nbsp;33</a>); hence three complete observations
give six equations and are theoretically adequate to determine
the elements of the orbit; but it had not hitherto
been found necessary to deal with the problem in this
form. The orbits of all the planets but Uranus had been
worked out gradually by the use of a series of observations
extending over centuries; and it was feasible to use observations
taken at particular times so chosen that certain
elements could be determined without any accurate knowledge
of the others; even Uranus had been under observation
for a considerable time before its path was determined
with anything like accuracy; and in the case of comets
not only was a considerable series of observations generally
available, but the problem was simplified by the fact that
the orbit could be taken to be nearly or quite a parabola
instead of an ellipse (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_190">§&nbsp;190</a>). The discovery
of the new planet Ceres on January 1st, 1801 (<a href="#para_294">§&nbsp;294</a>), and
its loss when it had only been observed for a few weeks,
presented virtually a new problem in the calculation of an
orbit. Gauss applied his new methods—including that
of least squares—to the observations available, and with
complete success, the planet being rediscovered at the
end of the year nearly in the position indicated by his
calculations.</p>

<p><a id="para_277"></a>277. The theory of the “reduction” of observations
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_218">§&nbsp;218</a>) was first systematised and very much
improved by <i>Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</i> (1784-1846), who
was for more than thirty years the director of the new
Prussian observatory at Königsberg. His first great work
was the reduction and publication of Bradley’s Greenwich
observations (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_218">§&nbsp;218</a>). This undertaking involved
an elaborate study of such disturbing causes as precession,
aberration, and refraction, as well as of the errors of Bradley’s
instruments. Allowance was made for these on a uniform and
systematic plan, and the result was the publication in 1818,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
under the title <i>Fundamenta Astronomiae</i>, of a catalogue of
the places of 3,222 stars as they were in 1755. A special
problem dealt with in the course of the work was that of
refraction. Although the complete theoretical solution
was then as now unattainable, Bessel succeeded in constructing
a table of refractions which agreed very closely
with observation and was presented in such a form that
the necessary correction for a star in almost any position
could be obtained with very little trouble. His general
methods of reduction—published finally in his <i>Tabulae
Regiomontanae</i> (1830)—also had the great advantage of
arranging the necessary calculations in such a way that
they could be performed with very little labour and by an
almost mechanical process, such as could easily be carried
out by a moderately skilled assistant. In addition to
editing Bradley’s observations, Bessel undertook a fresh
series of observations of his own, executed between the
years 1821 and 1833, upon which were based two new
catalogues, containing about 62,000 stars, which appeared
after his death.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="para_278"></a>278. The most memorable of Bessel’s special pieces of
work was the first definite detection of the parallax of a
fixed star. He abandoned the test of brightness as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
indication of nearness, and selected a star (<i>61 Cygni</i>)
which was barely visible to the naked eye but was remarkable
for its large proper motion (about 5″ per annum);
evidently if a star is moving at an assigned rate (in miles
per hour) through space, the nearer to the observer it is the
more rapid does its motion appear to be, so that apparent
rapidity of motion, like brightness, is a
probable but by no means infallible
indication of nearness. A modification
of Galilei’s differential method (chapter
<span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_129">§&nbsp;129</a>, and chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_263">§&nbsp;263</a>)
being adopted, the angular distance
of <i>61 Cygni</i> from two neighbouring
stars, the faintness and immovability
of which suggested their great distance
in space, was measured at frequent
intervals during a year. From the
changes in these distances σ <i>a</i>, σ <i>b</i>
(in fig. 85), the size of the small ellipse
described by σ could be calculated.
The result, announced at the end of
1838, was that the star had an annual
parallax of about 1∕3″ (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>,
<a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>), <i>i.e.</i> that the star was at such
distance that the greatest angular distance
of the earth from the sun viewed
from the star (the angle <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> σ <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> in fig. 86,
where <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> is the sun and <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> the earth)
was this insignificant angle.<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> The
result was confirmed, with slight alterations,
by a fresh investigation of
Bessel’s in 1839-40, but later work
seems to shew that the parallax is a
little less than 1∕2″.<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> With this latter
estimate, the apparent size of the earth’s path round the
sun as seen from the star is the same as that of a halfpenny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
at a distance of rather more than three miles. In other
words, the distance of the star is about 400,000 times the
distance of the sun, which is itself about 93,000,000 miles.
A mile is evidently a very small unit by which to measure
such a vast distance; and the practice of expressing such
distances by means of the time required by light to perform
the journey is often convenient. Travelling at the rate of
186,000 miles <i>per second</i> (<a href="#para_283">§&nbsp;283</a>), light takes rather more
than six years to reach us from <i>61 Cygni</i>.</p>

<p><a id="para_279"></a>279. Bessel’s solution of the great problem which had
baffled astronomers ever since the time of Coppernicus was
immediately followed by two others. Early in 1839 <i>Thomas
Henderson</i> (1798-1844) announced a parallax of nearly 1″
for the bright star α <i>Centauri</i> which he had observed at the
Cape, and in the following year <i>Friedrich Georg Wilhelm
Struve</i> (1793-1864) obtained from observations made at
Pulkowa a parallax of 1∕4″ for <i>Vega</i>; later work has reduced
these numbers to 3∕4″ and 1∕10″ respectively.</p>

<p>A number of other parallax determinations have subsequently
been made. An interesting variation in method was
made by the late Professor <i>Charles Pritchard</i> (1808-1893)
of Oxford by <i>photographing</i> the star to be examined and its
companions, and subsequently measuring the distances on
the photograph, instead of measuring the angular distances
directly with a micrometer.</p>

<p>At the present time some 50 stars have been ascertained
with some reasonable degree of probability to have measurable,
if rather uncertain, parallaxes; α <i>Centauri</i> still holds
its own as the nearest star, the light-journey from it being
about four years. A considerable number of other stars
have been examined with negative or highly uncertain
results, indicating that their parallaxes are too small to be
measured with our present means, and that their distances
are correspondingly great.</p>

<p><a id="para_280"></a>280. A number of star catalogues and star maps—too
numerous to mention separately—have been constructed
during this century, marking steady progress in our knowledge
of the position of the stars, and providing fresh
materials for ascertaining, by comparison of the state of
the sky at different epochs, such quantities as the proper
motions of the stars and the amount of precession. Among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
the most important is the great catalogue of 324,198 stars
in the northern hemisphere known as the Bonn <i>Durchmusterung</i>,
published in 1859-62 by Bessel’s pupil <i>Friedrich
Wilhelm August Argelander</i> (1799-1875); this was extended
(1875-85) so as to include 133,659 stars in a portion of
the southern hemisphere by <i>Eduard Schönfeld</i> (1828-1891);
and more recently Dr. <i>Gill</i> has executed at the Cape
photographic observations of the remainder of the southern
hemisphere, the reduction to the form of a catalogue (the
first instalment of which was published in 1896) having
been performed by Professor <i>Kapteyn</i> of Groningen. The
star places determined in these catalogues do not profess
to be the most accurate attainable, and for many purposes
it is important to know with the utmost accuracy the
positions of a smaller number of stars. The greatest
undertaking of this kind, set on foot by the German
Astronomical Society in 1867, aims at the construction, by
the co-operation of a number of observatories, of catalogues
of about 130,000 of the stars contained in the “approximate”
catalogues of Argelander and Schönfeld; nearly half of the
work has now been published.</p>

<p>The greatest scheme for a survey of the sky yet attempted
is the photographic chart, together with a less extensive
catalogue to be based on it, the construction of which was
decided on at an international congress held at Paris
in 1887. The whole sky has been divided between 18
observatories in all parts of the world, from Helsingfors in
the north to Melbourne in the south, and each of these is
now taking photographs with virtually identical instruments.
It is estimated that the complete chart, which is intended
to include stars of the 14th magnitude,<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> will contain about
20,000,000 stars, 2,000,000 of which will be catalogued
also.</p>

<p><a id="para_281"></a>281. One other great problem—that of the distance of
the sun—may conveniently be discussed under the head
of observational astronomy.</p>

<p>The transits of Venus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_202">§§&nbsp;202</a>, 227) which
occurred in 1874 and 1882 were both extensively observed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
the old methods of time-observation being supplemented
by photography and by direct micrometric measurements
of the positions of Venus while transiting.</p>

<p>The method of finding the distance of the sun by means
of observation of Mars in opposition (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_161">§&nbsp;161</a>)
has been employed on several occasions with considerable
success, notably by Dr. Gill at Ascension in 1877. A
method originally used by Flamsteed, but revived in 1857
by <i>Sir George Biddell Airy</i> (1801-1892), the late Astronomer
Royal, was adopted on this occasion. For the determination
of the parallax of a planet observations have to be made from
two different positions at a known distance apart; commonly
these are taken to be at two different observatories, as
far as possible removed from one another in latitude.
Airy pointed out that the same object could be attained if
only one observatory were used, but observations taken at
an interval of some hours, as the rotation of the earth on
its axis would in that time produce a known displacement
of the observer’s position and so provide the necessary
base line. The apparent shift of the planet’s position
could be most easily ascertained by measuring (with the
micrometer) its distances from neighbouring fixed stars.
This method (known as the <b>diurnal method</b>) has the great
advantage, among others, of being simple in application, a
single observer and instrument being all that is needed.</p>

<p>The diurnal method has also been applied with great
success to certain of the minor planets (<a href="#para_294">§&nbsp;294</a>). Revolving
as they do between Mars and Jupiter, they are all farther
off from us than the former; but there is the compensating
advantage that as a minor planet, unlike Mars, is, as a
rule, too small to shew any appreciable disc, its angular
distance from a neighbouring star is more easily measured.
The employment of the minor planets in this way was first
suggested by Professor <i>Galle</i> of Berlin in 1872, and recent
observations of the minor planets <i>Victoria</i>, <i>Sappho</i>, and <i>Iris</i>
in 1888-89, made at a number of observatories under the
general direction of Dr. Gill, have led to some of the most
satisfactory determinations of the sun’s distance.</p>

<p><a id="para_282"></a>282. It was known to the mathematical astronomers of
the 18th century that the distance of the sun could be
obtained from a knowledge of various perturbations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
members of the solar system; and Laplace had deduced
a value of the solar parallax from lunar theory. Improvements
in gravitational astronomy and in observation of the
planets and moon during the present century have added
considerably to the value of these methods. A certain
irregularity in the moon’s motion known as the <b>parallactic
inequality</b>, and another in the motion of the sun, called
the <b>lunar equation</b>, due to the displacement of the earth
by the attraction of the moon, alike depend on the ratio
of the distances of the sun and moon from the earth; if
the amount of either of these inequalities can be observed,
the distance of the sun can therefore be deduced, that of
the moon being known with great accuracy. It was by a
virtual application of the first of these methods that Hansen
(<a href="#para_286">§&nbsp;286</a>) in 1854, in the course of an elaborate investigation
of the lunar theory, ascertained that the current value of
the sun’s distance was decidedly too large, and Leverrier
(<a href="#para_288">§&nbsp;288</a>) confirmed the correction by the second method in
1858.</p>

<p>Again, certain changes in the orbits of our two neighbours,
Venus and Mars, are known to depend upon the
ratio of the masses of the sun and earth, and can hence
be connected, by gravitational principles, with the quantity
sought. Leverrier pointed out in 1861 that the motions
of Venus and of Mars, like that of the moon, were inconsistent
with the received estimate of the sun’s distance, and
he subsequently worked out the method more completely
and deduced (1872) values of the parallax. The displacements
to be observed are very minute, and their accurate
determination is by no means easy, but they are both
secular (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_242">§&nbsp;242</a>), so that in the course of time
they will be capable of very exact measurement. Leverrier’s
method, which is even now a valuable one, must therefore
almost inevitably outstrip all the others which are at present
known; it is difficult to imagine, for example, that the
transits of Venus due in 2004 and 2012 will have any
value for the purpose of the determination of the sun’s
distance.</p>

<p><a id="para_283"></a>283. One other method, in two slightly different forms,
has become available during this century. The displacement
of a star by aberration (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_210">§&nbsp;210</a>) depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
upon the ratio of the velocity of light to that of the earth
in its orbit round the sun; and observations of Jupiter’s
satellites after the manner of Roemer (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_162">§&nbsp;162</a>)
give the <b>light-equation</b>, or time occupied by light in
travelling from the sun to the earth. Either of these
astronomical quantities—of which aberration is the more
accurately known—can be used to determine the velocity
of light when the dimensions of the solar system are known,
or <i>vice versa</i>. No independent method of determining the
velocity of light was known until 1849, when <i>Hippolyte
Fizeau</i> (1819-1896) invented and successfully carried out
a laboratory method.</p>

<p>New methods have been devised since, and three comparatively
recent series of experiments, by M. <i>Cornu</i> in
France (1874 and 1876) and by Dr. <i>Michelson</i> (1879)
and Professor <i>Newcomb</i> (1880-82) in the United States,
agreeing closely with one another, combine to fix the velocity
of light at very nearly 186,300 miles (299,800 kilometres)
per second; the solar parallax resulting from this by means
of aberration is very nearly 8″·8.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p><a id="para_284"></a>284. Encke’s value of the sun’s parallax, 8″·571, deduced
from the transits of Venus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_227">§&nbsp;227</a>) in 1761 and
1769, and published in 1835, corresponding to a distance
of about 95,000,000 miles, was generally accepted till past
the middle of the century. Then the gravitational methods
of Hansen and Leverrier, the earlier determinations of the
velocity of light, and the observations made at the opposition
of Mars in 1862, all pointed to a considerably larger value
of the parallax; a fresh examination of the 18th century
observations shewed that larger values than Encke’s could
easily be deduced from them; and for some time—from
about 1860 onwards—a parallax of nearly 8″·95, corresponding
to a distance of rather more than 91,000,000 miles, was
in common use. Various small errors in the new methods
were, however, detected, and the most probable value of the
parallax has again increased. Three of the most reliable
methods, the diurnal method as applied to Mars in 1877,
the same applied to the minor planets in 1888-89, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
aberration, unite in giving values not differing from 8″·80
by more than two or three hundredths of a second. The
results of the last transits of Venus, the publication and
discussion of which have been spread over a good many
years, point to a somewhat larger value of the parallax.
Most astronomers appear to agree that a parallax of 8″·8,
corresponding to a distance of rather less than 93,000,000
miles, represents fairly the available data.</p>

<p><a id="para_285"></a>285. The minute accuracy of modern observations is
well illustrated by the recent discovery of a variation in
the latitude of several observatories. Observations taken at
Berlin in 1884-85 indicated a minute variation in the latitude;
special series of observations to verify this were set on
foot in several European observatories, and subsequently at
Honolulu and at Cordoba. A periodic alteration in latitude
amounting to about 1∕2″ emerged as the result. Latitude
being defined (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_221">§&nbsp;221</a>) as the angle which the
vertical at any place makes with the equator, which is
the same as the elevation of the pole above the horizon,
is consequently altered by any change in the equator, and
therefore by an alteration in the position of the earth’s poles
or the ends of the axis about which it rotates.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>S. C. Chandler</i> succeeded (1891 and subsequently)
in shewing that the observations in question could be in
great part explained by supposing the earth’s axis to undergo
a minute change of position in such a way that either pole
of the earth describes a circuit round its mean position in
about 427 days, never deviating more than some 30 feet
from it. It is well known from dynamical theory that a
rotating body such as the earth can be displaced in this
manner, but that if the earth were perfectly rigid the period
should be 306 days instead of 427. The discrepancy
between the two numbers has been ingeniously used as a
test of the extent to which the earth is capable of yielding—like
an elastic solid—to the various forces which tend to
strain it.</p>

<p><a id="para_286"></a>286. All the great problems of gravitational astronomy
have been rediscussed since Laplace’s time, and further
steps taken towards their solution.</p>

<p>Laplace’s treatment of the lunar theory was first developed
by <i>Marie Charles Theodore Damoiseau</i> (1768-1846), whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
<i>Tables de la Lune</i> (1824 and 1828) were for some time in
general use.</p>

<p>Some special problems of both lunar and planetary theory
were dealt with by <i>Siméon Denis Poisson</i> (1781-1840), who
is, however, better known as a writer on other branches of
mathematical physics than as an astronomer. A very
elaborate and detailed theory of the moon, investigated by
the general methods of Laplace, was published by <i>Giovanni
Antonio Amadeo Plana</i> (1781-1869) in 1832, but unaccompanied
by tables. A general treatment of both lunar
and planetary theories, the most complete that had appeared
up to that time, by <i>Philippe Gustave Doulcet de Pontécoulant</i>
(1795-1874), appeared in 1846, with the title <i>Théorie
Analytique du Système du Monde</i>; and an incomplete
lunar theory similar to his was published by <i>John William
Lubbock</i> (1803-1865) in 1830-34.</p>

<p>A great advance in lunar theory was made by <i>Peter
Andreas Hansen</i> (1795-1874) of Gotha, who published in
1838 and 1862-64 the treatises commonly known respectively
as the <i>Fundamenta</i><a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and the <i>Darlegung</i>,<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> and produced
in 1857 tables of the moon’s motion of such accuracy that
the discrepancies between the tables and observations in
the century 1750-1850 were never greater than 1″ or 2″.
These tables were at once used for the calculation of the
<i>Nautical Almanac</i> and other periodicals of the same kind,
and with some modifications have remained in use up to
the present day.</p>

<p>A completely new lunar theory—of great mathematical
interest and of equal complexity—was published by <i>Charles
Delaunay</i> (1816-1872) in 1860 and 1867. Unfortunately
the author died before he was able to work out the
corresponding tables.</p>

<p>Professor Newcomb of Washington (<a href="#para_283">§&nbsp;283</a>) has rendered
valuable services to lunar theory—as to other branches of
astronomy—by a number of delicate and intricate calculations,
the best known being his comparison of Hansen’s tables
with observation and consequent corrections of the tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<p>New methods of dealing with lunar theory were devised
by the late Professor <i>John Couch Adams</i> of Cambridge
(1819-1892), and similar methods have been developed by
Dr. <i>G. W. Hill</i> of Washington; so far they have not been
worked out in detail in such a way as to be available for
the calculation of tables, and their interest seems to be
at present mathematical rather than practical; but the
necessary detailed work is now in progress, and these and
allied methods may be expected to lead to a considerable
diminution of the present excessive intricacy of lunar
theory.</p>

<p><a id="para_287"></a>287. One special point in lunar theory may be worth
mentioning. The secular acceleration of the moon’s mean
motion which had perplexed astronomers since its first
discovery by Halley (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_201">§&nbsp;201</a>) had, as we have
seen (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_240">§&nbsp;240</a>), received an explanation in 1787
at the hands of Laplace. Adams, on going through the
calculation, found that some quantities omitted by Laplace
as unimportant had in reality a very sensible effect on the
result, so that a certain quantity expressing the rate of
increase of the moon’s motion came out to be between
5″ and 6″, instead of being about 10″, as Laplace had found
and as observation required. The correction was disputed
at first by several of the leading experts, but was confirmed
independently by Delaunay and is now accepted. The
moon appears in consequence to have a certain very minute
increase in speed for which the theory of gravitation affords
no explanation. An ingenious though by no means certain
explanation was suggested by Delaunay in 1865. It had
been noticed by Kant that <b>tidal friction</b>—that is, the friction
set up between the solid earth and the ocean as the result
of the tidal motion of the latter—would have the effect of
checking to some extent the rotation of the earth; but as
the effect seemed to be excessively minute and incapable
of precise calculation it was generally ignored. An attempt
to calculate its amount was, however, made in 1853 by
<i>William Ferrel</i>, who also pointed out that, as the period
of the earth’s rotation—the day—is our fundamental unit
of time, a reduction of the earth’s rate of rotation involves
the lengthening of our unit of time, and consequently produces
an apparent increase of speed in all other motions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
measured in terms of this unit. Delaunay, working independently,
arrived at like conclusions, and shewed that tidal
friction might thus be capable of producing just such an
alteration in the moon’s motion as had to be explained; if
this explanation were accepted the observed motion of the
moon would give a measure of the effect of tidal friction.
The minuteness of the quantities involved is shewn by
the fact that an alteration in the earth’s rotation equivalent
to the lengthening of the day by 1∕10 second in 10,000 years
is sufficient to explain the acceleration in question. Moreover
it is by no means certain that the usual estimate of
the amount of this acceleration—based as it is in part on
ancient eclipse observations—is correct, and even then a
part of it may conceivably be due to some indirect effect
of gravitation even more obscure than that detected by
Laplace, or to some other cause hitherto unsuspected.</p>

<p><a id="para_288"></a>288. Most of the writers on lunar theory already mentioned
have also made contributions to various parts of
planetary theory, but some of the most important advances
in planetary theory made since the death of Laplace have
been due to the French mathematician <i>Urbain Jean Joseph
Leverrier</i> (1811-1877), whose methods of determining the
distance of the sun have been already referred to (<a href="#para_282">§&nbsp;282</a>).
His first important astronomical paper (1839) was a discussion
of the stability (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_245">§&nbsp;245</a>) of the system
formed by the sun and the three largest and most distant
planets then known, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Subsequently
he worked out afresh the theory of the motion of
the sun and of each of the principal planets, and constructed
tables of them, which at once superseded earlier ones, and
are now used as the basis of the chief planetary calculations
in the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> and most other astronomical
almanacs. Leverrier failed to obtain a satisfactory agreement
between observation and theory in the case of
Mercury, a planet which has always given great trouble to
astronomers, and was inclined to explain the discrepancies
as due to the influence either of a planet revolving between
Mercury and the sun or of a number of smaller bodies
analogous to the minor planets (<a href="#para_294">§&nbsp;294</a>).</p>

<p>Researches of a more abstract character, connecting
planetary theory with some of the most recent advances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
in pure mathematics, have been carried out by <i>Hugo Gyldén</i>
(1841-1896), while one of the most eminent pure mathematicians
of the day, M. <i>Henri Poincaré</i> of Paris, has
recently turned his attention to astronomy, and is engaged
in investigations which, though they have at present but
little bearing on practical astronomy, seem likely to throw
important light on some of the general problems of celestial
mechanics.</p>

<p><a id="para_289"></a>289. One memorable triumph of gravitational astronomy,
the discovery of Neptune, has been described so often and
so fully elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> that a very brief account will suffice
here. Soon after the discovery of Uranus (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>,
<a href="#para_253">§&nbsp;253</a>) it was found that the planet had evidently been
observed, though not recognised as a planet, as early as
1690, and on several occasions afterwards.</p>

<p>When the first attempts were made to compute its orbit
carefully, it was found impossible satisfactorily to reconcile
the earlier with the later observations, and in Bouvard’s
tables (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_247">§&nbsp;247</a>, note) published in 1821 the
earlier observations were rejected. But even this drastic
measure did not cure the evil; discrepancies between the
observed and calculated places soon appeared and increased
year by year. Several explanations were proposed, and
more than one astronomer threw out the suggestion that
the irregularities might be due to the attraction of a hitherto
unknown planet. The first serious attempt to deduce from
the irregularities in the motion of Uranus the position of
this hypothetical body was made by Adams immediately
after taking his degree (1843). By October 1845 he had
succeeded in constructing an orbit for the new planet, and
in assigning for it a position differing (as we now know) by
less than 2° (four times the diameter of the full moon) from
its actual position. No telescopic search for it was, however,
undertaken. Meanwhile, Leverrier had independently
taken up the inquiry, and by August 31st, 1846, he, like
Adams, had succeeded in determining the orbit and the
position of the disturbing body. On the 23rd of the follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>ing
month Dr. Galle of the Berlin Observatory received
from Leverrier a request to search for it, and on the same
evening found close to the position given by Leverrier a
strange body shewing a small planetary disc, which was
soon recognised as a new planet, known now as Neptune.</p>

<p>It may be worth while noticing that the error in the
motion of Uranus which led to this remarkable discovery
never exceeded 2′, a quantity imperceptible to the ordinary
eye; so that if two stars were side by side in the sky, one
in the true position of Uranus and one in the calculated
position as given by Bouvard’s tables, an observer of
ordinary eyesight would see one star only.</p>

<p><a id="para_290"></a>290. The lunar tables of Hansen and Professor Newcomb,
and the planetary and solar tables of Leverrier, Professor
Newcomb, and Dr. Hill, represent the motions of
the bodies dealt with much more accurately than the corresponding
tables based on Laplace’s work, just as these were
in turn much more accurate than those of Euler, Clairaut,
and Halley. But the agreement between theory and observation
is by no means perfect, and the discrepancies are in
many cases greater than can be explained as being due to
the necessary imperfections in our observations.</p>

<p>The two most striking cases are perhaps those of Mercury
and the moon. Leverrier’s explanation of the irregularities
of the former (<a href="#para_288">§&nbsp;288</a>) has never been fully justified or
generally accepted; and the position of the moon as given
in the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> and in similar publications is
calculated by means of certain corrections to Hansen’s
tables which were deduced by Professor Newcomb from
observation and have no justification in the theory of
gravitation.</p>

<p><a id="para_291"></a>291. The calculation of the paths of comets has become
of some importance during this century owing to
the discovery of a number of comets revolving round the
sun in comparatively short periods. Halley’s comet
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_231">§&nbsp;231</a>) reappeared duly in 1835, passing through
its perihelion within a few days of the times predicted by
three independent calculators; and it may be confidently
expected again about 1910. Four other comets are now
known which, like Halley’s, revolve in elongated elliptic
orbits, completing a revolution in between 70 and 80 years;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
two of these have been seen at two returns, that known as
Olbers’s comet in 1815 and 1887, and the Pons-Brooks
comet in 1812 and 1884. Fourteen other comets with periods
varying between 3-1∕3 years (Encke’s) and 14 years (Tuttle’s),
have been seen at more than one return; about a dozen
more have periods estimated at less than a century; and
20 or 30 others move in orbits that are decidedly elliptic,
though their periods are longer and consequently not known
with much certainty. Altogether the paths of about 230
or 240 comets have been computed, though many are
highly uncertain.</p>

<p><a id="para_292"></a>292. In the theory of the tides the first important advance
made after the publication of the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i> was
the collection of actual tidal observations on a large scale,
their interpretation, and their comparison with the results
of theory. The pioneers in this direction were Lubbock
(<a href="#para_286">§&nbsp;286</a>), who presented a series of papers on the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
to the Royal Society in 1830-37, and <i>William Whewell</i>
(1794-1866), whose papers on the subject appeared between
1833 and 1851. Airy (<a href="#para_281">§&nbsp;281</a>), then Astronomer Royal,
also published in 1845 an important treatise dealing with
the whole subject, and discussing in detail the theory of
tides in bodies of water of limited extent and special form.
The analysis of tidal observations, a large number of which
taken from all parts of the world are now available, has
subsequently been carried much further by new methods
due to Lord <i>Kelvin</i> and Professor <i>G. H. Darwin</i>. A
large quantity of information is thus available as to the
way in which tides actually vary in different places and
according to different positions of the sun and moon.</p>

<p>Of late years a good deal of attention has been paid to
the effect of the attraction of the sun and moon in producing
alterations—analogous to oceanic tides—in the earth itself.
No body is perfectly rigid, and the forces in question must
therefore produce some tidal effect. The problem was first
investigated by Lord Kelvin in 1863, subsequently by
Professor Darwin and others. Although definite numerical
results are hardly attainable as yet, the work so far carried
out points to the comparative smallness of these bodily
tides and the consequent great rigidity of the earth, a result
of interest in connection with geological inquiries into the
nature of the interior of the earth.</p>

<p>Some speculations connected with tidal friction are
referred to elsewhere (<a href="#para_320">§&nbsp;320</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_293"></a>293. The series of propositions as to the stability of
the solar system established by Lagrange and Laplace
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_244">§§&nbsp;244</a>, 245), regarded as abstract propositions
mathematically deducible from certain definite assumptions,
have been confirmed and extended by later mathematicians
such as Poisson and Leverrier; but their claim to give
information as to the condition of the actual solar system
at an indefinitely distant future time receives much less
assent now than formerly. The general trend of scientific
thought has been towards the fuller recognition of the
merely approximate and probable character of even the best
ascertained portions of our knowledge; “exact,” “always,”
and “certain” are words which are disappearing from the
scientific vocabulary, except as convenient abbreviations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
Propositions which profess to be—or are commonly interpreted
as being—“exact” and valid throughout all future
time are consequently regarded with considerable distrust,
unless they are clearly mere abstractions.</p>

<p>In the case of the particular propositions in question the
progress of astronomy and physics has thrown a good deal
of emphasis on some of the points in which the assumptions
required by Lagrange and Laplace are not satisfied by the
actual solar system.</p>

<p>It was assumed for the purposes of the stability theorems
that the bodies of the solar system are perfectly rigid; in
other words, the motions relative to one another of the parts
of any one body were ignored. Both the ordinary tides of
the ocean and the bodily tides to which modern research
has called attention were therefore left out of account.
Tidal friction, though at present very minute in amount
(<a href="#para_287">§&nbsp;287</a>), differs essentially from the perturbations which
form the main subject-matter of gravitational astronomy,
inasmuch as its action is irreversible. The stability theorems
shewed in effect that the ordinary perturbations produced
effects which sooner or later compensated one another, so
that if a particular motion was accelerated at one time it
would be retarded at another; but this is not the case with
tidal friction. Tidal action between the earth and the
moon, for example, gradually lengthens both the day and the
month, and increases the distance between the earth and
the moon. Solar tidal action has a similar though smaller
effect on the sun and earth. The effect in each case—as
far as we can measure it at all—seems to be minute almost
beyond imagination, but there is no compensating action
tending at any time to reverse the process. And on the
whole the energy of the bodies concerned is thereby lessened.
Again, modern theories of light and electricity require space
to be filled with an “ether” capable of transmitting certain
waves; and although there is no direct evidence that it in
any way affects the motions of earth or planets, it is difficult
to imagine a medium so different from all known forms of
ordinary matter as to offer <i>no</i> resistance to a body moving
through it. Such resistance would have the effect of slowly
bringing the members of the solar system nearer to the sun,
and gradually diminishing their times of revolution round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
it. This is again an irreversible tendency for which we
know of no compensation.</p>

<p>In fact, from the point of view which Lagrange and
Laplace occupied, the solar system appeared like a clock
which, though not going quite regularly, but occasionally
gaining and occasionally losing, nevertheless required no
winding up; whereas modern research emphasises the
analogy to a clock which after all is running down, though
at an excessively slow rate. Modern study of the sun’s
heat (<a href="#para_319">§&nbsp;319</a>) also indicates an irreversible tendency towards
the “running down” of the solar system in another way.</p>

<p><a id="para_294"></a>294. Our account of modern descriptive astronomy may
conveniently begin with planetary discoveries.</p>

<p>The first day of the 19th century was marked by the
discovery of a new planet, known as Ceres. It was seen
by <i>Giuseppe Piazzi</i> (1746-1826) as a strange star in a
region of the sky which he was engaged in mapping, and
soon recognised by its motion as a planet. Its orbit—first
calculated by Gauss (<a href="#para_276">§&nbsp;276</a>)—shewed it to belong
to the space between Mars and Jupiter, which had been
noted since the time of Kepler as abnormally large. That
a planet should be found in this region was therefore
no great surprise; but the discovery by <i>Heinrich Olbers</i>
(1758-1840), scarcely a year later (March 1802), of a second
body (<i>Pallas</i>), revolving at nearly the same distance from
the sun, was wholly unexpected, and revealed an entirely
new planetary arrangement. It was an obvious conjecture
that if there was room for two planets there was
room for more, and two fresh discoveries (<i>Juno</i> in 1804,
<i>Vesta</i> in 1807) soon followed.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span>—Photographic trail of a minor planet.
<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 377.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p>The new bodies were very much smaller than any of
the other planets, and, so far from readily shewing a
planetary disc like their neighbours Mars and Jupiter,
were barely distinguishable in appearance from fixed stars,
except in the most powerful telescopes of the time; hence
the name <b>asteroid</b> (suggested by William Herschel) or
<b>minor planet</b> has been generally employed to distinguish
them from the other planets. Herschel attempted to
measure their size, and estimated the diameter of the largest
at under 200 miles (that of Mercury, the smallest of the
ordinary planets, being 3000), but the problem was in reality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
too difficult even for his unrivalled powers of observation.
The minor planets were also found to be remarkable for
the great inclination and eccentricity of some of the orbits;
the path of Pallas, for example, makes an angle of 35° with
the ecliptic, and its eccentricity is 1∕4, so that its least distance
from the sun is not much more than half its greatest
distance. These characteristics suggested to Olbers that
the minor planets were in reality fragments of a primeval
planet of moderate dimensions which had been blown
to pieces, and the theory, which fitted most of the facts
then known, was received with great favour in an age
when “catastrophes” were still in fashion as scientific
explanations.</p>

<p>The four minor planets named were for nearly 40 years
the only ones known; then a fifth was discovered in
1845 by <i>Karl Ludwig Hencke</i> (1793-1866) after 15 years,
of search. Two more were found in 1847, another in
1848, and the number has gone on steadily increasing
ever since. The process of discovery has been very much
facilitated by improvements in star maps, and latterly by
the introduction of photography. In this last method,
first used by Dr. <i>Max Wolf</i> of Heidelberg in 1891, a
photographic plate is exposed for some hours; any planet
present in the region of the sky photographed, having
moved sensibly relatively to the stars in this period, is thus
detected by the trail which its image leaves on the plate.
The annexed figure shews (near the centre) the trail of the
minor planet <i>Svea</i>, discovered by Dr. Wolf on March
21st, 1892.</p>

<p>At the end of 1897 no less than 432 minor planets were
known, of which 92 had been discovered by a single
observer, M. <i>Charlois</i> of Nice, and only nine less by
Professor <i>Palisa</i> of Vienna.</p>

<p>The paths of the minor planets practically occupy the
whole region between the paths of Mars and Jupiter,
though few are near the boundaries; no orbit is more
inclined to the ecliptic than that of Pallas, and the
eccentricities range from almost zero up to about 1∕3.</p>

<p>Fig. 89 shews the orbits of the first two minor planets
discovered, as well as of No. 323 (<i>Brucia</i>), which comes
nearest to the sun, and of No. 361 (not yet named),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
which goes farthest from it. All the orbits are described
in the standard, or west to east, direction. The most
interesting characteristic in the distribution of the minor
planets, first noted in 1866 by <i>Daniel Kirkwood</i> (1815-1895)
is the existence of comparatively clear spaces in the regions
where the disturbing action of Jupiter would by Lagrange’s
principle (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_243">§&nbsp;243</a>) be most effective: for instance,
at a distance from the sun about five-eighths that of Jupiter,
a planet would by Kepler’s law revolve exactly <i>twice</i> as fast
as Jupiter; and accordingly there is a gap among the minor
planets at about this distance.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>—Paths of minor planets.</div>
</div>

<p>Estimates of the sizes and masses of the minor planets
are still very uncertain. The first direct measurement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
of any of the discs which seem reliable are those of
Professor <i>E. E. Barnard</i>, made at the Lick Observatory
in 1894 and 1895; according to these the three largest
minor planets, Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta, have diameters
of nearly 500 miles, about 300 and about 250 miles
respectively. Their sizes compared with the moon are
shewn on the diagram (fig. 90). An alternative method—the
only one available except for a few of the very largest
of the minor planets—is to measure the amount of light received,
and hence to deduce the size, on the assumption that
the reflective power is the same as that of some known planet.
This method gives diameters of about 300 miles for the
brightest and of about a dozen miles for the faintest known.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>—Comparative sizes of three minor planets and the moon.</div>
</div>

<p>Leverrier calculated from the perturbations of Mars that
the total mass of all known or unknown bodies between
Mars and Jupiter could not exceed a fourth that of the earth;
but such knowledge of the sizes as we can derive from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
light-observations seems to indicate that the total mass of
those at present known is many hundred times less than
this limit.</p>

<p><a id="para_295"></a>295. Neptune and the minor planets are the only planets
which have been discovered during this century, but several
satellites have been added to our system.</p>

<p>Barely a fortnight after the discovery of Neptune (1846)
a satellite was detected by <i>William Lassell</i> (1799-1880)
at Liverpool. Like the satellites of Uranus, this revolves
round its primary from east to west—that is, in the direction
contrary to that of all the other known motions of the solar
system (certain long-period comets not being counted).</p>

</div>

<p>Two years later (September 16th, 1848) <i>William Cranch
Bond</i> (1789-1859) discovered, at the Harvard College<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
Observatory, an, eighth satellite of Saturn, called <i>Hyperion</i>,
which was detected independently by Lassell two days
afterwards. In the following year Bond discovered that
Saturn was accompanied by a third comparatively dark ring-now
commonly known as the <b>crape ring</b>—lying immediately
inside the bright rings (see fig. 95); and the
discovery was made independently a fortnight later by
<i>William Rutter Dawes</i> (1799-1868) in England. Lassell
discovered in 1851 two new satellites of Uranus, making
a total of four belonging to that planet. The next discoveries
were those of two satellites of Mars, known as
<i>Deimos</i> and <i>Phobos</i>, by Professor <i>Asaph Hall</i> of Washington
on August 11th and 17th, 1877. These are remarkable
chiefly for their close proximity to Mars and their extremely
rapid motion, the nearer one revolving more rapidly than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Mars rotates, so that to the Martians it must rise in the
west and set in the east. Lastly, Jupiter’s system received
an addition after nearly three centuries by Professor Barnard’s
discovery at the Lick Observatory (September 9th, 1892) of
an extremely faint fifth satellite, a good deal nearer to Jupiter
than the nearest of Galilei’s satellites (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_121">§&nbsp;121</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_296"></a>296. The surfaces of the various planets and satellites
have been watched with the utmost care by an army of
observers, but the observations have to a large extent
remained without satisfactory interpretation, and little is
known of the structure or physical condition of the bodies
concerned.</p>

<p>Astronomers are naturally most familiar with the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
of our nearest neighbour, the moon. The visible half has
been elaborately mapped, and the heights of the chief
mountain ranges measured by means of their shadows.
Modern knowledge has done much to dispel the view, held
by the earlier telescopists and shared to some extent even
by Herschel, that the moon closely resembles the earth and
is suitable for inhabitants like ourselves. The dark spaces
which were once taken to be seas and still bear that name
are evidently covered with dry rock; and the craters with
which the moon is covered are all—with one or two doubtful
exceptions—extinct; the long dark lines known as
<b>rills</b> and formerly taken for river-beds have clearly no
water in them. The question of a lunar atmosphere is
more difficult: if there is air its density must be very small,
some hundredfold less than that of our atmosphere at the
surface of the earth; but with this restriction there seems
to be no bar to the existence of a lunar atmosphere of
considerable extent, and it is difficult to explain certain
observations without assuming the existence of some atmosphere.</p>

<p><a id="para_297"></a>297. Mars, being the nearest of the superior planets, is
the most favourably situated for observation. The chief
markings on its surface—provisionally interpreted as being
land and water—are fairly permanent and therefore
recognisable; several tolerably consistent maps of the
surface have been constructed; and by observation of
certain striking features the rotation period has been
determined to a fraction of a second. Signor <i>Schiaparelli</i>
of Milan detected at the opposition of 1877 a number of
intersecting dark lines generally known as <b>canals</b>, and as
the result of observations made during the opposition of
1881-82 announced that certain of them appeared doubled,
two nearly parallel lines being then seen instead of one.
These remarkable observations have been to a great extent
confirmed by other observers, but remain unexplained.</p>

<p>The visible surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn appear to be
layers of clouds; the low density of each planet (1·3 and
·7 respectively, that of water being 1 and of the earth 5·5),
the rapid changes on the surface, and other facts indicate
that these planets are to a great extent in a fluid condition,
and have a high temperature at a very moderate distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
below the visible surface. The surface markings are in each
case definite enough for the rotation periods to be fixed with
some accuracy; though it is clear in the case of Jupiter,
and probably also in that of Saturn, that—as with the sun
(<a href="#para_298">§&nbsp;298</a>)—different parts of the surface move at different rates.</p>

<p>Laplace had shewn that Saturn’s ring (or rings) could not
be, as it appeared, a uniform solid body; he rashly inferred—without
any complete investigation—that it might be
an irregularly weighted solid body. The first important
advance was made by <i>James Clerk Maxwell</i> (1831-1879),
best known as a writer on electricity and other branches
of physics. Maxwell shewed (1857) that the rings could
neither be continuous solid bodies nor liquid, but that
all the important dynamical conditions would be satisfied
if they were made up of a very large number of small
solid bodies revolving independently round the sun.<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> The
theory thus suggested on mathematical grounds has received
a good deal of support from telescopic evidence.
The rings thus bear to Saturn a relation having some
analogy to that which the minor planets bear to the sun;
and Kirkwood pointed out in 1867 that Cassini’s division
between the two main rings can be explained by the
perturbations due to certain of the satellites, just as the
corresponding gaps in the minor planets can be explained
by the action of Jupiter (<a href="#para_294">§&nbsp;294</a>).</p>

<p>The great distance of Uranus and Neptune naturally
makes the study of them difficult, and next to nothing is
known of the appearance or constitution of either; their
rotation periods are wholly uncertain.</p>

<p>Mercury and Venus, being inferior planets, are never very
far from the sun in the sky, and therefore also extremely
difficult to observe satisfactorily. Various bright and dark
markings on their surfaces have been recorded, but different
observers give very different accounts of them. The rotation
periods are also very uncertain, though a good many astronomers
support the view put forward by Sig. Schiaparelli, in
1882 and 1890 for Mercury and Venus respectively, that
each rotates in a time equal to its period of revolution round
the sun, and thus always turns the same face towards the
sun. Such a motion—which is analogous to that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
moon round the earth and of Japetus round Saturn
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_267">§&nbsp;267</a>)—could be easily explained as the
result of tidal action at some past time when the planets
were to a great extent fluid.</p>

<p><a id="para_298"></a>298. Telescopic study of the surface of the sun during
the century has resulted in an immense accumulation of
detailed knowledge of peculiarities of the various markings
on the surface. The most interesting results of a general
nature are connected with the distribution and periodicity
of sun-spots. The earliest telescopists had noticed that the
number of spots visible on the sun varied from time to time,
but no law of variation was established till 1851, when <i>Heinrich
Schwabe</i> of Dessau (1789-1875) published in Humboldt’s
<i>Cosmos</i> the results of observations of sun-spots carried out
during the preceding quarter of a century, shewing that the
number of spots visible increased and decreased in a
tolerably regular way in a period of about ten years.</p>

<p>Earlier records and later observations have confirmed
the general result, the period being now estimated as
slightly over 11 years on the average, though subject to
considerable fluctuations. A year later (1852) three independent
investigators, Sir <i>Edward Sabine</i> (1788-1883) in
England, <i>Rudolf Wolf</i> (1816-1893) and <i>Alfred Gautier</i>
(1793-1881) in Switzerland, called attention to the remarkable
similarity between the periodic variations of sun-spots
and of various magnetic disturbances on the earth. Not
only is the period the same, but it almost invariably happens
that when spots are most numerous on the sun magnetic
disturbances are most noticeable on the earth, and that
similarly the times of scarcity of the two sets of phenomena
coincide. This wholly unexpected and hitherto quite unexplained
relationship has been confirmed by the occurrence
on several occasions of decided magnetic disturbances
simultaneously with rapid changes on the surface of the sun.</p>

<p>A long series of observations of the position of spots on
the sun undertaken by <i>Richard Christopher Carrington</i>
(1826-1875) led to the first clear recognition of the difference
in the rate of rotation of the different parts of the
surface of the sun, the period of rotation being fixed (1859)
at about 25 days at the equator, and two and a half days
longer half-way between the equator and the poles; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
in addition spots were seen to have also independent
“proper motions.” Carrington also established (1858) the
scarcity of spots in the immediate neighbourhood of the
equator, and confirmed statistically their prevalence in
the adjacent regions, and their great scarcity more than
about 35° from the equator; and noticed further certain
regular changes in the distribution of spots on the sun in
the course of the 11-year cycle.</p>

<p>Wilson’s theory (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_268">§&nbsp;268</a>) that spots are depressions
was confirmed by an extensive series of photographs
taken at Kew in 1858-72, shewing a large preponderance
of cases of the perspective effect noticed by him; but, on
the other hand, Mr. <i>F. Howlett</i>, who has watched the sun
for some 35 years and made several thousand drawings of
spots, considers (1894) that his observations are decidedly
against Wilson’s theory. Other observers are divided in
opinion.</p>

<p><a id="para_299"></a>299. <b>Spectrum analysis</b>, which has played such an important
part in recent astronomical work, is essentially a
method of ascertaining the nature of a body by a process
of sifting or analysing into different components the light
received from it.</p>

<p>It was first clearly established by Newton, in 1665-66
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">IX.</span>, <a href="#para_168">§&nbsp;168</a>), that ordinary white light, such as sunlight,
is composite, and that by passing a beam of sunlight—with
proper precautions—through a glass prism it can be
decomposed into light of different colours; if the beam so
decomposed is received on a screen, it produces a band of
colours known as a <b>spectrum</b>, red being at one end and
violet at the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_97"></a>
<img src="images/i_p386b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span>—Fraunhofer’s map of the solar spectrum.
(The red end of the spectrum is on the left, the violet on the right.)
<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 387.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p>Now according to modern theories light consists essentially
of a series of disturbances or waves transmitted at
extremely short but regular intervals from the luminous
object to the eye, the medium through which the disturbances
travel being called <b>ether</b>. The most important
characteristic distinguishing different kinds of light is the
interval of time or space between one wave and the next,
which is generally expressed by means of <b>wave-length</b>, or
the distance between any point of one wave and the corresponding
point of the next. Differences in wave-length
shew themselves most readily as differences of colour; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
that light of a particular colour found at a particular part of
the spectrum has a definite wave-length. At the extreme
violet end of the spectrum, for example, the wave-length
is about fifteen millionths of an inch, at the red end it is
about twice as great; from which it follows (<a href="#para_283">§&nbsp;283</a>), from
the known velocity of light, that when we look at the red end
of a spectrum about 400 billion waves of light enter the eye
per second, and twice that number when we look at the
other end. Newton’s experiment thus shews that a prism
sorts out light of a composite nature according to the wave-length
of the different kinds of light present. The same
thing can be done by substituting for the prism a so-called
<b>diffraction-grating</b>, and this is for many purposes superseding
the prism. In general it is necessary, to ensure
purity in the spectrum and to make it large enough, to
admit light through a narrow slit, and to use certain lenses
in combination with one or more prisms or a grating; and
the arrangement is such that the spectrum is not thrown
on to a screen, but either viewed directly by the eye or
photographed. The whole apparatus is known as a <b>spectroscope</b>.</p>

<p>The solar spectrum appeared to Newton as a continuous
band of colours; but in 1802 <i>William Hyde Wollaston</i>
(1766-1828) observed certain dark lines running across the
spectrum, which he took to be the boundaries of the natural
colours. A few years later (1814-15) the great Munich
optician <i>Joseph Fraunhofer</i> (1787-1826) examined the sun’s
spectrum much more carefully, and discovered about 600
such dark lines, the positions of 324 of which he mapped
(see fig. 97). These dark lines are accordingly known as
<b>Fraunhofer lines</b>: for purposes of identification Fraunhofer
attached certain letters of the alphabet to a few of the most
conspicuous; the rest are now generally known by the wave-length
of the corresponding kind of light.</p>

<p>It was also gradually discovered that dark bands could
be produced artificially in spectra by passing light through
various coloured substances; and that, on the other hand, the
spectra of certain flames were crossed by various <i>bright</i> lines.</p>

<p>Several attempts were made to explain and to connect
these various observations, but the first satisfactory and
tolerably complete explanation was given in 1859 by <i>Gustav<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
Robert Kirchhoff</i> (1824-1887) of Heidelberg, who at first
worked in co-operation with the chemist Bunsen.</p>

<p>Kirchhoff shewed that a luminous solid or liquid—or,
as we now know, a highly compressed gas—gives a continuous
spectrum; whereas a substance in the gaseous
state gives a spectrum consisting of bright lines (with or
without a faint continuous spectrum), and these bright
lines depend on the particular substance and are characteristic
of it. Consequently the presence of a particular
substance in the form of gas in a hot body can be inferred
from the presence of its characteristic lines in the spectrum
of the light. The <i>dark</i> lines in the solar spectrum were
explained by the fundamental principle—often known as
Kirchhoff’s law—that a body’s capacity for stopping or
absorbing light of a particular wave-length is proportional
to its power, under like conditions, of giving out the
same light. If, in particular, light from a luminous solid
or liquid body, giving a continuous spectrum, passes through
a gas, the gas absorbs light of the same wave-length as that
which it itself gives out: if the gas gives out more light
of these particular wave-lengths than it absorbs, then the
spectrum is crossed by the corresponding bright lines;
but if it absorbs more than it gives out, then there is a
deficiency of light of these wave-lengths and the corresponding
parts of the spectrum appear dark—that is, the
spectrum is crossed by dark lines in the same position as
the bright lines in the spectrum of the gas alone. Whether
the gas absorbs more or less than it gives out is essentially
a question of temperature, so that if light from a hot solid
or liquid passes through a gas at a higher temperature a
spectrum crossed by bright lines is the result, whereas if
the gas is cooler than the body behind it dark lines are
seen in the spectrum.</p>

<p><a id="para_300"></a>300. The presence of the Fraunhofer lines in the
spectrum of the sun shews that sunlight comes from a
hot solid or liquid body (or from a highly compressed gas),
and that it has passed through cooler gases which have
absorbed light of the wave-lengths corresponding to the
dark lines. These gases must be either round the sun or
in our atmosphere: and it is not difficult to shew that,
although some of the Fraunhofer lines are due to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
atmosphere, the majority cannot be, and are therefore
caused by gases in the atmosphere of the sun.</p>

<p>For example, the metal sodium when vaporised gives a
spectrum characterised by two nearly coincident bright
lines in the yellow part of the spectrum; these agree in
position with a pair of dark lines (known as D) in the
spectrum of the sun (see fig. 97); Kirchhoff inferred therefore
that the atmosphere of the sun contains sodium. By
comparison of the dark lines in the spectrum of the sun
with the bright lines in the spectra of metals and other substances,
their presence or absence in the solar atmosphere
can accordingly be ascertained. In the case of iron—which
has an extremely complicated spectrum—Kirchhoff succeeded
in identifying 60 lines (since increased to more
than 2,000) in its spectrum with dark lines in the spectrum
of the sun. Some half-dozen other known elements were
also identified by Kirchhoff in the sun.</p>

<p>The inquiry into solar chemistry thus started has since
been prosecuted with great zeal. Improved methods and
increased care have led to the construction of a series of
maps of the solar spectrum, beginning with Kirchhoff’s own,
published in 1861-62, of constantly increasing complexity
and accuracy. Knowledge of the spectra of the metals has
also been greatly extended. At the present time between
30 and 40 elements have been identified in the sun, the
most interesting besides those already mentioned being
hydrogen, calcium, magnesium, and carbon.</p>

<p>The first spectroscopic work on the sun dealt only with
the light received from the sun as a whole, but it was soon
seen that by throwing an image of the sun on to the slit
of the spectroscope by means of a telescope the spectrum
of a particular part of the sun’s surface, such as a spot or
a facula, could be obtained; and an immense number of
observations of this character have been made.</p>

<p><a id="para_301"></a>301. Observations of total eclipses of the sun have shewn
that the bright surface of the sun as we ordinarily see it
is not the whole, but that outside this there is an envelope
of some kind too faint to be seen ordinarily but becoming
visible when the intense light of the sun itself is cut off
by the moon. A white halo of considerable extent round
the eclipsed sun, now called the <b>corona</b>, is referred to by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
Plutarch, and discussed by Kepler (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span>, <a href="#para_145">§&nbsp;145</a>)
Several 18th century astronomers noticed a red streak along
some portion of the common edge of the sun and moon,
and red spots or clouds here and there (cf. chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, <a href="#para_205">§&nbsp;205</a>).
But little serious attention was given to the subject till after
the total solar eclipse of 1842. Observations made then
and at the two following eclipses of 1851 and 1860, in the
latter of which years photography was for the first time
effectively employed, made it evident that the red streak
represented a continuous envelope of some kind surrounding
the sun, to which the name of <b>chromosphere</b> has been given,
and that the red objects, generally known as <b>prominences</b>,
were in general projecting parts of the chromosphere, though
sometimes detached from it. At the eclipse of 1868 the
spectrum of the prominences and the chromosphere was
obtained, and found to be one of bright lines, shewing that
they consisted of gas. Immediately afterwards M. <i>Janssen</i>,
who was one of the observers of the eclipse, and Sir
<i>J. Norman Lockyer</i> independently devised a method
whereby it was possible to get the spectrum of a prominence
at the edge of the sun’s disc in ordinary daylight, without
waiting for an eclipse; and a modification introduced by
Sir <i>William Huggins</i> in the following year (1869) enabled
the form of a prominence to be observed spectroscopically.
Recently (1892) Professor <i>G. E. Hale</i> of Chicago has
succeeded in obtaining by a photographic process a representation
of the whole of the chromosphere and prominences,
while the same method gives also photographs of faculae
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, <a href="#para_153">§&nbsp;153</a>) on the visible surface of the sun.</p>

<p>The most important lines ordinarily present in the
spectrum of the chromosphere are those of hydrogen, two
lines (H and K) which have been identified with some
difficulty as belonging to calcium, and a yellow line the
substance producing which, known as <b>helium</b>, has only
recently (1895) been discovered on the earth. But the
chromosphere when disturbed and many of the prominences
give spectra containing a number of other lines.</p>

</div>

<p>The corona was for some time regarded as of the nature
of an optical illusion produced in the atmosphere. That it
is, at any rate in great part, an actual appendage of the sun
was first established in 1869 by the American astronomers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
Professor <i>Harkness</i> and Professor <i>C. A. Young</i>, who discovered
a bright line—of unknown origin<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>—in its spectrum,
thus shewing that it consists in part of glowing gas.
Subsequent spectroscopic work shews that its light is partly
reflected sunlight.</p>

<p>The corona has been carefully studied at every solar
eclipse during the last 30 years, both with the spectroscope
and with the telescope, supplemented by photography, and
a number of ingenious theories of its constitution have been
propounded; but our present knowledge of its nature hardly
goes beyond Professor Young’s description of it as “an
inconceivably attenuated cloud of gas, fog, and dust, surrounding
the sun, formed and shaped by solar forces.”</p>

<p><a id="para_302"></a>302. The spectroscope also gives information as to certain
motions taking place on the sun. It was pointed out in 1842
by <i>Christian Doppler</i> (1803-1853), though in an imperfect
and partly erroneous way, that if a luminous body is
approaching the observer, or <i>vice versa</i>, the waves of light
are as it were crowded together and reach the eye at shorter
intervals than if the body were at rest, and that the character
of the light is thereby changed. The colour and the position
in the spectrum both depend on the interval between one
wave and the next, so that if a body giving out light of a
particular wave-length, <i>e.g.</i> the blue light corresponding to
the F line of hydrogen, is approaching the observer rapidly,
the line in the spectrum appears slightly on one side of its
usual position, being displaced towards the violet end of
the spectrum; whereas if the body is receding the line
is, in the same way, displaced in the opposite direction.
This result is usually known as <b>Doppler’s principle</b>. The
effect produced can easily be expressed numerically. If,
for example, the body is approaching with a speed equal
to 1∕1000 of light, then 1001 waves enter the eye or the
spectroscope in the same time in which there would otherwise
only be 1000; and there is in consequence a virtual
shortening of the wave-length in the ratio of 1001 to
1000. So that if it is found that a line in the spectrum
of a body is displaced from its ordinary position in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
a way that its wave-length is apparently decreased by
1∕1000 part, it may be inferred that the body is approaching
with the speed just named, or about 186 miles per
second, and if the wave-length appears increased by the
same amount (the line being displaced towards the red end
of the spectrum) the body is receding at the same rate.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest observations of the prominences by
Sir J. N. Lockyer (1868), and of spots and other features
of the sun by the same and other observers, shewed displacements
and distortions of the lines in the spectrum,
which were soon seen to be capable of interpretation by
this method, and pointed to the existence of violent disturbances
in the atmosphere of the sun, velocities as
great as 300 miles per second being not unknown. The
method has received an interesting confirmation from observations
of the spectrum of opposite edges of the sun’s disc,
of which one is approaching and the other receding owing
to the rotation of the sun. Professor <i>Dunér</i> of Upsala has
by this process ascertained (1887-89) the rate of rotation
of the surface of the sun beyond the regions where spots
exist, and therefore outside the limits of observations such
as Carrington’s (<a href="#para_298">§&nbsp;298</a>).</p>

<p><a id="para_303"></a>303. The spectroscope tells us that the atmosphere of
the sun contains iron and other metals in the form of
vapour; and the photosphere, which gives the continuous
part of the solar spectrum, is certainly hotter. Moreover
everything that we know of the way in which heat is communicated
from one part of a body to another shews that
the outer regions of the sun, from which heat and light are
radiating on a very large scale, must be the coolest parts,
and that the temperature in all probability rises very rapidly
towards the interior. These facts, coupled with the low
density of the sun (about a fourth that of the earth) and
the violently disturbed condition of the surface, indicate that
the bulk of the interior of the sun is an intensely hot and
highly compressed mass of gas. Outside this come in order,
their respective boundaries and mutual relations being, however,
very uncertain, first the photosphere, generally regarded
as a cloud-layer, then the <b>reversing stratum</b> which produces
most of the Fraunhofer lines, then the chromosphere and
prominences, and finally the corona. Sun-spots, faculae, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
prominences have been explained in a variety of different
ways as joint results of solar disturbances of various
kinds; but no detailed theory that has been given explains
satisfactorily more than a fraction of the observed facts
or commands more than a very limited amount of assent
among astronomical experts.</p>

<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 393.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_304"></a>304. More than 200 comets have been seen during the
present century; not only have the motions of most of them
been observed and their orbits computed (<a href="#para_291">§&nbsp;291</a>), but in a large
number of cases the appearance and structure of the comet
have been carefully observed telescopically, while latterly
spectrum analysis and photography have also been employed.</p>

<p>Independent lines of inquiry point to the extremely unsubstantial
character of a comet, with the possible exception
of the bright central part or <b>nucleus</b>, which is nearly always
present. More than once, as in 1767 (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_248">§&nbsp;248</a>), a
comet has passed close to some member of the solar system,
and has never been ascertained to affect its motion. The
mass of a comet is therefore very small, but its bulk or
volume, on the other hand, is in general very great, the tail
often being millions of miles in length; so that the density
must be extremely small. Again, stars have often been observed
shining through a comet’s tail (as shewn in fig. 99),
and even through the head at no great distance from the
nucleus, their brightness being only slightly, if at all, affected.
Twice at least (1819, 1861) the earth has passed through a
comet’s tail, but we were so little affected that the fact was
only discovered by calculations made after the event. The
early observation (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>, <a href="#para_69">§&nbsp;69</a>) that a comet’s tail points
away from the sun has been abundantly verified; and from
this it follows that very rapid changes in the position of the
tail must occur in some cases. For example, the comet of
1843 passed very close to the sun at such a rate that in
about two hours it had passed from one side of the sun to
the opposite; it was then much too near the sun to be seen,
but if it followed the ordinary law its tail, which was unusually
long, must have entirely reversed its direction within this
short time. It is difficult to avoid the inference that the
tail is not a permanent part of the comet, but is a stream
of matter driven off from it in some way by the action of
the sun, and in this respect comparable with the smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
issuing from a chimney. This view is confirmed by the
fact that the tail is only developed when the comet
approaches the sun, a comet when at a great distance from
the sun appearing usually as an indistinct patch of nebulous
light, with perhaps a brighter spot representing the nucleus.
Again, if the tail be formed by an outpouring of matter from
the comet, which only takes place when the comet is near
the sun, the more often a comet approaches the sun the
more must it waste away; and we find accordingly that the
short-period comets, which return to the neighbourhood of
the sun at frequent intervals (<a href="#para_291">§&nbsp;291</a>), are inconspicuous
bodies. The same theory is supported by the shape of the
tail. In some cases it is straight, but more commonly it is
curved to some extent, and the curvature is then always
<i>backwards</i> in relation to the comet’s motion. Now by
ordinary dynamical principles matter shot off from the head
of the comet while it is revolving round the sun would
tend, as it were, to lag behind more and more the farther
it receded from the head, and an apparent backward
curvature of the tail—less or greater according to the speed
with which the particles forming the tail were repelled—would
be the result. Variations in curvature of the tails
of different comets, and the existence of two or more
differently curved tails of the same comet, are thus readily
explained by supposing them made of different materials,
repelled from the comet’s head at different speeds.</p>

<p>The first application of the spectroscope to the study of
comets was made in 1864 by <i>Giambattista Donati</i> (1826-1873),
best known as the discoverer of the magnificent
comet of 1858. A spectrum of three bright bands, wider
than the ordinary “lines,” was obtained, but they were
not then identified. Four years later Sir William Huggins
obtained a similar spectrum, and identified it with that
of a compound of carbon and hydrogen. Nearly every
comet examined since then has shewn in its spectrum
bright bands indicating the presence of the same or some
other hydrocarbon, but in a few cases other substances
have also been detected. A comet is therefore in part
at least self-luminous, and some of the light which it sends
us is that of a glowing gas. It also shines to a considerable
extent by reflected sunlight; there is nearly always a con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>tinuous
spectrum, and in a few cases—first in 1881—the
spectrum has been distinct enough to shew the Fraunhofer
lines crossing it. But the continuous spectrum seems also
to be due in part to solid or liquid matter in the comet itself,
which is hot enough to be self-luminous.</p>

<p><a id="para_305"></a>305. The work of the last 30 or 40 years has established
a remarkable relation between comets and the minute bodies
which are seen in the form of <b>meteors</b> or <b>shooting stars</b>.
Only a few of the more important links in the chain of
evidence can, however, be mentioned. Showers of shooting
stars, the occurrence of which has been known from quite
early times, have been shewn to be due to the passage of
the earth through a swarm of bodies revolving in elliptic
orbits round the sun. The paths of four such swarms
were ascertained with some precision in 1866-67, and found
in each case to agree closely with the paths of known
comets. And since then a considerable number of other
cases of resemblance or identity between the paths of
meteor swarms and of comets have been detected. One
of the four comets just referred to, known as Biela’s, with
a period of between six and seven years, was duly seen on
several successive returns, but in 1845-46 was observed
first to become somewhat distorted in shape, and afterwards
to have divided into two distinct comets; at the next return
(1852) the pair were again seen; but since then nothing
has been seen of either portion. At the end of November in
each year the earth almost crosses the path of this comet, and
on two occasions (1872, and 1885) it did so nearly at the time
when the comet was due at the same spot; if, as seemed
likely, the comet had gone to pieces since its last appearance,
there seemed a good chance of falling in with some of its
remains, and this expectation was fulfilled by the occurrence
on both occasions of a meteor shower much more brilliant
than that usually observed at the same date.</p>

<p>Biela’s comet is not the only comet which has shewn
signs of breaking up; Brooks’s comet of 1889, which is
probably identical with Lexell’s (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_248">§&nbsp;248</a>), was
found to be accompanied by three smaller companions;
as this comet has more than once passed extremely close
to Jupiter, a plausible explanation of its breaking up is at
once given in the attractive force of the planet. Moreover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
certain systems of comets, the members of which revolve
in the same orbit but separated by considerable intervals
of time, have also been discovered. Tebbutt’s comet of
1881 moves in practically the same path as one seen in
1807, and the great comet of 1880, the great comet of 1882
(shewn in fig. 99), and a third which appeared in 1887,
all move in paths closely resembling that of the comet of
1843, while that of 1668 is more doubtfully connected
with the same system. And it is difficult to avoid regarding
the members of a system as fragments of an earlier comet,
which has passed through the stages in which we have
actually seen the comets of Biela and Brooks.</p>

<p>Evidence of such different kinds points to an intimate
connection between comets and meteors, though it is
perhaps still premature to state confidently that meteors
are fragments of decayed comets, or that conversely comets
are swarms of meteors.</p>

<p><a id="para_306"></a>306. Each of the great problems of sidereal astronomy
which Herschel formulated and attempted to solve has
been elaborately studied by the astronomers of the 19th
century. The multiplication of observatories, improvements
in telescopes, and the introduction of photography—to
mention only three obvious factors of progress—have added
enormously to the extent and accuracy of our knowledge of
the stars, while the invention of spectrum analysis has thrown
an entirely new light on several important problems.</p>

<p>William Herschel’s most direct successor was his son
<i>John Frederick William</i> (1792-1871), who was not only an
astronomer, but also made contributions of importance to
pure mathematics, to physics, to the nascent art of photography,
and to the philosophy of scientific discovery. He
began his astronomical career about 1816 by re-measuring,
first alone, then in conjunction with <i>James South</i> (1785-1867),
a number of his father’s double stars. The first
result of this work was a catalogue, with detailed measurements,
of some hundred double and multiple stars (published
in 1824), which formed a valuable third term of comparison
with his father’s observations of 1781-82 and 1802-03, and
confirmed in several cases the slow motions of revolution
the beginnings of which had been observed before. A
great survey of nebulae followed, resulting in a catalogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
(1833) of about 2500, of which some 500 were new and
2000 were his father’s, a few being due to other observers;
incidentally more than 3000 pairs of stars close enough
together to be worth recording as double stars were observed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<a id="Fig_100"></a>
<img src="images/i_p396b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>—The nebula about η Argus.
<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 397.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_307"></a>307. Then followed his well-known expedition to the
Cape of Good Hope (1833-1838), where he “swept” the
southern skies in very much the same way in which his
father had explored the regions visible in our latitude.
Some 1200 double and multiple stars, and a rather larger
number of new nebulae, were discovered and studied, while
about 500 known nebulae were re-observed; star-gauging on
William Herschel’s lines was also carried out on an extensive
scale. A number of special observations of interest were
made almost incidentally during this survey: the remarkable
variable star η <i>Argus</i> and the nebula surrounding it (a
modern photograph of which is reproduced in fig. 100), the
wonderful collections of nebulae clusters and stars, known
as the <i>Nubeculae</i> or <i>Magellanic Clouds</i>, and Halley’s comet
were studied in turn; and the two faintest satellites of
Saturn then known (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_255">§&nbsp;255</a>) were seen again
for the first time since the death of their discoverer.</p>

<p>An important investigation of a somewhat different
character—that of the amount of heat received from the
sun—was also carried out (1837) during Herschel’s residence
at the Cape; and the result agreed satisfactorily with that
of an independent inquiry made at the same time in France
by <i>Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet</i> (1791-1868). In both
cases the heat received on a given area of the earth in a
given time from direct sunshine was measured; and allowance
being made for the heat stopped in the atmosphere
as the sun’s rays passed through it, an estimate was formed
of the total amount of heat received annually by the earth
from the sun, and hence of the total amount radiated by
the sun in all directions, an insignificant fraction of which
(one part in 2,000,000,000) is alone intercepted by the
earth. But the allowance for the heat intercepted in our
atmosphere was necessarily uncertain, and later work, in
particular that of Dr. <i>S. P. Langley</i> in 1880-81, shews that
it was very much under-estimated by both Herschel and
Pouillet. According to Herschel’s results, the heat received
annually from the sun—including that intercepted in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
atmosphere—would be sufficient to melt a shell of ice
120 feet thick covering the whole earth; according to
Dr. Langley, the thickness would be about 160 feet.<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p><a id="para_308"></a>308. With his return to England in 1838 Herschel’s
career as an observer came to an end; but the working out
of the results of his Cape observations, the arrangement
and cataloguing of his own and his father’s discoveries,
provided occupation for many years. A magnificent volume
on the <i>Results of Astronomical Observations made during the
years 1834-8 at the Cape of Good Hope</i> appeared in 1847;
and a catalogue of all known nebulae and clusters, amounting
to 5,079, was presented to the Royal Society in 1864,
while a corresponding catalogue of more than 10,000 double
and multiple stars was never finished, though the materials
collected for it were published posthumously in 1879. John
Herschel’s great catalogue of nebulae has since been revised
and enlarged by Dr. <i>Dreyer</i>, the result being a list of 7,840
nebulae and clusters known up to the end of 1887; and
a supplementary list of discoveries made in 1888-94
published by the same writer contains 1,529 entries, so that
the total number now known is between 9,000 and 10,000,
of which more than half have been discovered by the two
Herschels.</p>

<p><a id="para_309"></a>309. Double stars have been discovered and studied by
a number of astronomers besides the Herschels. One of
the most indefatigable workers at this subject was the elder
Struve (<a href="#para_279">§&nbsp;279</a>), who was successively director of the two
Russian observatories of Dorpat and Pulkowa. He
observed altogether some 2,640 double and multiple stars,
measuring in each case with care the length and direction
of the line joining the two components, and noting other
peculiarities, such as contrasts in colour between the
members of a pair. He paid attention only to double stars
the two components of which were not more than 32″ apart,
thus rejecting a good many which William Herschel would
have noticed; as the number of known doubles rapidly
increased, it was clearly necessary to concentrate attention
on those which might with some reasonable degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
probability turn out to be genuine binaries (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>,
<a href="#para_264">§&nbsp;264</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to a number of minor papers Struve published
three separate books on the subject in 1827, 1837, and 1852.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>
A comparison of his own earlier and later observations, and
of both with Herschel’s earlier ones, shewed about 100 cases
of change of relative positions of two members of a pair,
which indicated more or less clearly a motion of revolution,
and further results of a like character have been obtained
from a comparison of Struve’s observations with those of
later observers.</p>

the two components at various times between 1781 and 1897,
(The observations of 1781 and 1802 were only enough to
determine the direction of the line joining the two components,
not its length.)</div>
</div>

<p>William Herschel’s observations of binary systems
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_264">§&nbsp;264</a>) only sufficed to shew that a motion of
revolution of some kind appeared to be taking place; it
was an obvious conjecture that the two members of a pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
attracted one another according to the law of gravitation,
so that the motion of revolution was to some extent
analogous to that of a planet round the sun; if this were
the case, then each star of a pair should describe an ellipse
(or conceivably some other conic) round the other, or each
round the common centre of gravity, in accordance with
Kepler’s laws, and the apparent path as seen on the sky
should be of this nature but in general foreshortened by
being projected on to the celestial sphere. The first attempt
to shew that this was actually the case was made by ξ <i>Ursae</i>, which
was found to be revolving in a period of about 60 years.</p>

<p>Many thousand double stars have been discovered by
the Herschels, Struve, and a number of other observers,
including several living astronomers, among whom Professor
<i>S. W. Burnham</i> of Chicago, who has discovered
some 1300, holds a leading place. Among these stars there
are about 300 which we have fair reason to regard as
binary, but not more than 40 or 50 of the orbits can be
regarded as at all satisfactorily known. One of the most
satisfactory is that of Savary’s star ξ <i>Ursae</i>, which is shewn
in fig. 101. Apart from the binaries discovered by the
spectroscopic method (<a href="#para_314">§&nbsp;314</a>), which form to some extent
a distinct class, the periods of revolution which have been
computed range between about ten years and several
centuries, the longer periods being for the most part
decidedly uncertain.</p>

<p><a id="para_310"></a>310. William Herschel’s telescopes represented for some
time the utmost that could be done in the construction of
reflectors; the first advance was made by Lord <i>Rosse</i>
(1800-1867), who—after a number of less successful experiments—finally
constructed (1845), at Parsonstown in
Ireland, a reflecting telescope nearly 60 feet in length, with
a mirror which was six feet across, and had consequently a
“light-grasp” more than double that of Herschel’s greatest
telescope. Lord Rosse used the new instrument in the first
instance to re-examine a number of known nebulae, and in
the course of the next few years discovered a variety of new
features, notably the spiral form of certain nebulae (fig. 102),
and the resolution into apparent star clusters of a number
of nebulae which Herschel had been unable to resolve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
and had accordingly put into “the shining fluid” class
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_260">§&nbsp;260</a>). This last discovery, being exactly
analogous to Herschel’s experience when he first began to
examine nebulae hitherto only observed with inferior telescopes,
naturally led to a revival of the view that nebulae
are indistinguishable from clusters of stars, though many
of the arguments from probability urged by Herschel and
others were in reality unaffected by the new discoveries.</p>

<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 400.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_311"></a>311. The question of the status of nebulae in its simplest
form may be said to have been settled by the first
application of spectrum analysis. Fraunhofer (<a href="#para_299">§&nbsp;299</a>) had
seen as early as 1823 that stars had spectra characterised
like that of the sun by dark lines, and more complete
investigations made soon after Kirchhoff’s discoveries by
several astronomers, in particular by Sir William Huggins
and by the eminent Jesuit astronomer <i>Angelo Secchi</i>
(1818-1878), confirmed this result as regards nearly all
stars observed.</p>

<p>The first spectrum of a nebula was obtained by Sir
William Huggins in 1864, and was seen to consist of three
<i>bright</i> lines; by 1868 he had examined 70, and found in
about one-third of the cases, including that of the Orion
nebula, a similar spectrum of bright lines. In these cases
therefore the luminous part of the nebula is gaseous, and
Herschel’s suggestion of a “shining fluid” was confirmed
in the most satisfactory way. In nearly all cases three
bright lines are seen, one of which is a hydrogen line, while
the other two have not been identified, and in the case of
a few of the brighter nebulae some other lines have also
been seen. On the other hand, a considerable number of
nebulae, including many of those which appear capable of
telescopic resolution into star clusters, give a continuous
spectrum, so that there is no clear spectroscopic evidence
to distinguish them from clusters of stars, since the dark
lines seen usually in the spectra of the latter could hardly
be expected to be visible in the case of such faint objects
as nebulae.</p>

<p><a id="para_312"></a>312. Stars have been classified, first by Secchi (1863),
afterwards in slightly different ways by others, according to
the general arrangement of the dark lines in their spectra;
and some attempts have been made to base on these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
differences inferences as to the relative “ages,” or at any
rate the stages of development, of different stars.</p>

<p>Many of the dark lines in the spectra of stars have been
identified, first by Sir William Huggins in 1864, with the
lines of known terrestrial elements, such as hydrogen, iron,
sodium, calcium; so that a certain identity between the
materials of which our own earth is made and that of
bodies so remote as the fixed stars is thus established.</p>

<p>In addition to the classes of stars already mentioned, the
spectroscope has shewn the existence of an extremely interesting
if rather perplexing class of stars, falling into
several subdivisions, which seem to form a connecting
link between ordinary stars and nebulae, for, though indistinguishable
telescopically from ordinary stars, their
spectra shew <i>bright</i> lines either periodically or regularly.
A good many stars of this class are variable, and several
“new” stars which have appeared and faded away of late
years have shewn similar characteristics.</p>

<p><a id="para_313"></a>313. The first application to the fixed stars of the spectroscopic
method (<a href="#para_302">§&nbsp;302</a>) of determining motion towards or away
from the observer was made by Sir William Huggins in 1868.
A minute displacement from its usual position of a dark
hydrogen line (F) in the spectrum of Sirius was detected,
and interpreted as shewing that the star was receding from
the solar system at a considerable speed. A number of
other stars were similarly observed in the following year,
and the work has been taken up since by a number of
other observers, notably at Potsdam under the direction
of Professor <i>H. C. Vogel</i>, and at Greenwich.</p>

<p class="psig">[<small><i>To face p. 403.</i></small></p></div>
</div>

<p><a id="para_314"></a>314. A very remarkable application of this method to
binary stars has recently been made. If two stars are
revolving round one another, their motions towards and
away from the earth are changing regularly and are different;
hence, if the light from both stars is received in the
spectroscope, two spectra are formed—one for each star—the
lines of which shift regularly relatively to one another.
If a particular line, say the F line, common to the spectra
of both stars, is observed when both stars are moving
towards (or away from) the earth at the same rate—which
happens twice in each revolution—only one line is seen;
but when they are moving differently, if the spectroscope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
be powerful enough to detect the minute quantity involved,
the line will appear doubled, one component being due to
one star and one to the other. A periodic doubling of
this kind was detected at the end of 1889 by Professor
<i>E. C. Pickering</i> of Harvard in the case of ζ <i>Ursae</i>, which
was thus for the first time shewn to be binary, and found
to have the remarkably short period of only 104 days.
This discovery was followed almost immediately by Professor
Vogel’s detection of a periodical shift in the position
of the dark lines in the spectrum of the variable star Algol
(chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_266">§&nbsp;266</a>); but as in this case no doubling of the
lines can be seen, the inference is that the companion star
is nearly or quite dark, so that as the two revolve round
one another the spectrum of the bright star shifts in the
manner observed. Thus the eclipse-theory of Algol’s
variability received a striking verification.</p>

<p>A number of other cases of both classes of spectroscopic
binary stars (as they may conveniently be called) have
since been discovered. The upper part of fig. 103 shews
the doubling of one of the lines in the spectrum of the
double star β <i>Aurigae</i>; and the lower part shews the
corresponding part of the spectrum at a time when the line
appeared single.</p>

<p><a id="para_315"></a>315. Variable stars of different kinds have received a
good deal of attention during this century, particularly
during the last few years. About 400 stars are now clearly
recognised as variable, while in a large number of other
cases variability of light has been suspected; except, however,
in a few cases, like that of Algol, the causes of
variability are still extremely obscure.</p>

<p><a id="para_316"></a>316. The study of the relative brightness of stars—a
branch of astronomy now generally known as stellar <b>photometry</b>—has
also been carried on extensively during the
century and has now been put on a scientific basis. The
traditional classification of stars into magnitudes, according
to their brightness, was almost wholly arbitrary, and
decidedly uncertain. As soon as exact quantitative comparisons
of stars of different brightness began to be carried
out on a considerable scale, the need of a more precise
system of classification became felt. John Herschel was
one of the pioneers in this direction; he suggested a scale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
capable of precise expression, and agreeing roughly, at
any rate as far as naked-eye stars are concerned, with the
current usages; while at the Cape he measured carefully
the light of a large number of bright stars and classified
them on this principle. According to the scale now generally
adopted, first suggested in 1856 by <i>Norman Robert
Pogson</i> (1829-1891), the light of a star of any magnitude
bears a fixed ratio (which is taken to be 2·512 ...) to that
of a star of the next magnitude. The number is so chosen
that a star of the sixth magnitude—thus defined—is 100
times fainter than one of the first magnitude.<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> Stars of
intermediate brightness have magnitudes expressed by
fractions which can be at once calculated (according to
a simple mathematical rule) when the ratio of the light
received from the star to that received from a standard star
has been observed.<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Most of the great star catalogues (<a href="#para_280">§&nbsp;280</a>) have included
estimates of the magnitudes of stars. The most extensive
and accurate series of measurements of star brightness have
been those executed at Harvard and at Oxford under the
superintendence of Professor E. C. Pickering and the late
Professor Pritchard respectively. Both catalogues deal with
stars visible to the naked eye; the Harvard catalogue
(published in 1884) comprises 4,260 stars between the
North Pole and 30° southern declination, and the <i>Uranometria
Nova Oxoniensis</i> (1885), as it is called, only goes
10° south of the equator and includes 2,784 stars. Portions
of more extensive catalogues dealing with fainter stars, in
progress at Harvard and at Potsdam, have also been
published.</p>

<p><a id="para_317"></a>317. The great problem to which Herschel gave so
much attention, that of the general arrangement of the
stars and the structure of the system, if any, formed
by them and the nebulae, has been affected in a variety
of ways by the additions which have been made to our
knowledge of the stars. But so far are we from any
satisfactory solution of the problem that no modern theory
can fairly claim to represent the facts now known to us as well
as Herschel’s earlier theory fitted the much scantier stock
which he had at his command. In this as in so many
cases an increase of knowledge has shewn the insufficiency
of a previously accepted theory, but has not provided a
successor. Detailed study of the form of the Milky Way
(cf. fig. 104) and of its relation to the general body of stars
has shewn the inadequacy of any simple arrangement of
stars to represent its appearance; William Herschel’s cloven
grindstone, the ring which his son was inclined to substitute
for it as the result of his Cape studies, and the more
complicated forms which later writers have suggested, alike
fail to account for its peculiarities. Again, such evidence
as we have of the distance of the stars, when compared
with their brightness, shews that there are large variations
in their actual sizes as well as in their apparent sizes, and
thus tells against the assumption of a certain uniformity
which underlay much of Herschel’s work. The “island
universe” theory of nebulae, partially abandoned by
Herschel after 1791 (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, <a href="#para_260">§&nbsp;260</a>), but brought into
credit again by Lord Rosse’s discoveries (<a href="#para_310">§&nbsp;310</a>), scarcely
survived the spectroscopic proof of the gaseous character
of certain nebulae. Other evidence has pointed clearly to
intimate relations between nebulae and stars generally;
Herschel’s observation that nebulae are densest in regions
farthest from the Milky Way has been abundantly verified—as
far as irresoluble nebulae are concerned—while
obvious star clusters shew an equally clear preference for
the neighbourhood of the Milky Way. In many cases again
individual stars or groups seen on the sky in or near a
nebula have been clearly shewn, either by their arrangement
or in some cases by peculiarities of their spectra, to be really
connected with the nebula, and not merely to be accidentally
in the same direction. Stars which have bright lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
in their spectra (<a href="#para_312">§&nbsp;312</a>) form another link connecting
nebulae with stars.</p>

<p>A good many converging lines of evidence thus point
to a greater variety in the arrangement, size, and structure
of the bodies with which the telescope makes us acquainted
than seemed probable when sidereal astronomy was first
seriously studied; they also indicate the probability that
these bodies should be regarded as belonging to a
single system, even if it be of almost inconceivable
complexity, rather than to a number of perfectly distinct
systems of a simpler type.</p>

<p><a id="para_318"></a>318. Laplace’s nebular hypothesis (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span>, <a href="#para_250">§&nbsp;250</a>)
was published a little more than a century ago (1796), and
has been greatly affected by progress in various departments
of astronomical knowledge. Subsequent discoveries
of planets and satellites (§§&nbsp;294, 295) have marred to some
extent the uniformity and symmetry of the motions of the
solar system on which Laplace laid so much stress; but it
is not impossible to give reasonable explanations of the
backward motions of the satellites of the two most distant
planets, and of the large eccentricity and inclination of the
paths of some of the minor planets, while apart from these
exceptions the number of bodies the motions of which
have the characteristics which Laplace pointed out has
been considerably increased. The case for some sort of
common origin of the bodies of the solar system has perhaps
in this way gained as much as it has lost. Again, the
telescopic evidence which Herschel adduced (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>,
<a href="#para_261">§&nbsp;261</a>) in favour of the existence of certain processes of
condensation in nebulae has been strengthened by later
evidence of a similar character, and by the various pieces
of evidence already referred to which connect nebulae with
single stars and with clusters. The differences in the
spectra of stars also receive their most satisfactory explanation
as representing different stages of condensation of
bodies of the same general character.</p>

<p><a id="para_319"></a>319. An entirely new contribution to the problem has
resulted from certain discoveries as to the nature of heat,
culminating in the recognition (about 1840-50) of heat as
only one form of what physicists now call <b>energy</b>, which
manifests itself also in the motion of bodies, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
separation of bodies which attract one another, as well as
in various electrical, chemical, and other ways. With this
discovery was closely connected the general theory known
as the <b>conservation of energy</b>, according to which energy,
though capable of many transformations, can neither be
increased nor decreased in quantity. A body which, like
the sun, is giving out heat and light is accordingly thereby
losing energy, and is like a machine doing work; either
then it is receiving energy from some other source to
compensate this loss or its store of energy is diminishing.
But a body which goes on indefinitely giving out heat and
light without having its store of energy replenished is
exactly analogous to a machine which goes on working
indefinitely without any motive power to drive it; and both
are alike impossible.</p>

<p>The results obtained by John Herschel and Pouillet in
1836 (<a href="#para_307">§&nbsp;307</a>) called attention to the enormous expenditure
of the sun in the form of heat, and astronomers thus had to
face the problem of explaining how the sun was able to go
on radiating heat and light in this way. Neither in the
few thousand years of the past covered by historic records,
nor in the enormously great periods of which geologists
and biologists take account, is there any evidence of any
important permanent alteration in the amount of heat and
light received annually by the earth from the sun. Any
theory of the sun’s heat must therefore be able to account
for the continual expenditure of heat at something like the
present rate for an immense period of time. The obvious
explanation of the sun as a furnace deriving its heat from
combustion is found to be totally inadequate when put to
the test of figures, as the sun could in this way be kept
going at most for a few thousand years. The explanation
now generally accepted was first given by the great German
physicist <i>Hermann von Helmholtz</i> (1821-1894) in a popular
lecture in 1854. The sun possesses an immense store of
energy in the form of the mutual gravitation of its parts;
if from any cause it shrinks, a certain amount of gravitational
energy is necessarily lost and takes some other form.
In the shrinkage of the sun we have therefore a possible
source of energy. The precise amount of energy liberated
by a definite amount of shrinkage of the sun depends upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
the internal distribution of density in the sun, which is
uncertain, but making any reasonable assumption as to this
we find that the amount of shrinking required to supply
the sun’s expenditure of heat would only diminish the
diameter by a few hundred feet annually, and would
therefore be imperceptible with our present telescopic
power for centuries, while no earlier records of the sun’s
size are accurate enough to shew it. It is easy to calculate
on the same principles the amount of energy liberated by a
body like the sun in shrinking from an indefinitely diffused
condition to its present state, and from its present state to
one of assigned greater density; the result being that we
can in this way account for an expenditure of sun-heat at
the present rate for a period to be counted in millions of
years in either past or future time, while if the rate of
expenditure was less in the remote past or becomes less
in the future the time is extended to a corresponding
extent.</p>

<p>No other cause that has been suggested is competent
to account for more than a small fraction of the actual
heat-expenditure of the sun; the gravitational theory
satisfies all the requirements of astronomy proper, and goes
at any rate some way towards meeting the demands of
biology and geology.</p>

<p>If then we accept it as provisionally established, we
are led to the conclusion that the sun was in the past
larger and less condensed than now, and by going sufficiently
far back into the past we find it in a condition not
unlike the primitive nebula which Laplace presupposed,
with the exception that it need not have been hot.</p>

<p><a id="para_320"></a>320. A new light has been thrown on the possible
development of the earth and moon by Professor G. H.
Darwin’s study of the effects of tidal friction (cf. §&nbsp;287 and
§§&nbsp;292, 293). Since the tides increase the length of the
day and month and gradually repel the moon from the
earth, it follows that in the past the moon was nearer to
the earth than now, and that tidal action was consequently
much greater. Following out this clue. Professor Darwin
found, by a series of elaborate calculations published in
1879-81, strong evidence of a past time when the moon
was close to the earth, revolving round it in the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
in which the earth rotated on its axis, which was then a
little over two hours. The two bodies, in fact, were moving
as if they were connected; it is difficult to avoid the
probable inference that at an earlier stage the two really
were one, and that the moon is in reality a fragment of the
earth driven off from it by the too-rapid spinning of the
earth, or otherwise.</p>

<p>Professor Darwin has also examined the possibility of
explaining in a similar way the formation of the satellites
of the other planets and of the planets themselves from
the sun, but the circumstances of the moon-earth system
turn out to be exceptional, and tidal influence has been
less effective in other cases, though it gives a satisfactory
explanation of certain peculiarities of the planets and their
satellites. More recently (1892) Dr. <i>See</i> has applied a
somewhat similar line of reasoning to explain by means
of tidal action the development of double stars from an
earlier nebulous condition.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, we may say that the outcome of the
19th century study of the problem of the early history
of the solar system has been to discredit the details of
Laplace’s hypothesis in a variety of ways, but to establish
on a firmer basis the general view that the solar system
has been formed by some process of condensation out of
an earlier very diffused mass bearing a general resemblance
to one of the nebulae which the telescope shews us, and
that stars other than the sun are not unlikely to have been
formed in a somewhat similar way; and, further, the theory
of tidal friction supplements this general but vague theory,
by giving a rational account of a process which seems to
have been the predominant factor in the development of
the system formed by our own earth and moon, and to have
had at any rate an important influence in a number of
other cases.</p>

<h2 id="AUTHORITIES_AND_BOOKS_FOR_STUDENTS">AUTHORITIES AND BOOKS FOR STUDENTS.</h2>


<h3>I. <span class="smcap">General.</span></h3>

<p>I have made great use throughout of R. Wolf’s <i>Geschichte der
Astronomie</i>, and of the six volumes of Delambre’s <i>Histoire
de l’Astronomie</i> (<i>Ancienne</i>, 2 vols.; <i>du Moyen Age</i>, 1 vol.;
<i>Moderne</i>, 2 vols.; <i>du Dixhuitième Siècle</i>, 1 vol.). I shall subsequently
refer to these books simply as <i>Wolf</i> and <i>Delambre</i>
respectively. I have used less often the astronomical sections
of Whewell’s <i>History of the Inductive Sciences</i> (referred to as
<i>Whewell</i>), and I am indebted—chiefly for dates and references—to
the histories of mathematics written respectively by Marie,
W. W. R. Ball, and Cajori, to Poggendorff’s <i>Handwörterbuch
der Exacten Wissenschaften</i>, and to articles in various biographical
dictionaries, encyclopaedias, and scientific journals.
Of general treatises on astronomy Newcomb’s <i>Popular Astronomy</i>,
Young’s <i>General Astronomy</i>, and Proctor’s <i>Old and New
Astronomy</i> have been the most useful for my purposes.</p>

<p>It is difficult to make a selection among the very large number
of books on astronomy which are adapted to the general reader.
For students who wish for an introductory account of astronomy
the Astronomer Royal’s <i>Primer of Astronomy</i> may be recommended;
Young’s <i>Elements of Astronomy</i> is a little more advanced,
and Sir R. S. Ball’s <i>Story of the Heavens</i>, Newcomb’s <i>Popular
Astronomy</i>, and Proctor’s <i>Old and New Astronomy</i> enter into
the subject in much greater detail. Young’s <i>General Astronomy</i>
may also be recommended to those who are not afraid of a
little mathematics. There are also three modern English books
dealing generally with the history of astronomy, in all of which
the biographical element is much more prominent than in this
book: viz. Sir R. S. Ball’s <i>Great Astronomers</i>, Lodge’s <i>Pioneers
of Science</i>, and Morton’s <i>Heroes of Science: Astronomers</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span></p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Special Periods.</span></h3>


<p><i>Chapters I. and II.</i>—In addition to the general histories quoted
above—especially <i>Wolf</i>—I have made most use of Tannery’s
<i>Recherches sur l’Histoire de l’Astronomie Ancienne</i> and of several
biographical articles (chiefly by De Morgan) in Smith’s <i>Dictionary
of Classical Biography and Mythology</i>. Ideler’s <i>Chronologische
Untersuchungen</i>, Hankel’s <i>Geschichte der Mathematik im Alterthum
und Mittelalter</i>, G. C. Lewis’s <i>Astronomy of the Ancients</i>,
and Epping &amp; Strassmaier’s <i>Astronomisches aus Babylon</i> have
also been used to some extent. Unfortunately my attention was
only called to Susemihl’s <i>Geschichte der Griechischen Litteratur
in der Alexandriner Zeit</i> when most of my book was in proof,
and I have consequently been able to make but little use of it.</p>

<p>I have in general made no attempt to consult the original
Greek authorities, but I have made some use of translations
of Aristarchus, of the <i>Almagest</i>, and of the astronomical writings
of Plato and Aristotle.</p>


<p><i>Chapter III.</i>—The account of Eastern astronomy is based
chiefly on Delambre, and on Hankel’s <i>Geschichte der Mathematik
im Alterthum und Mittelalter</i>; to a less extent on Whewell.
For the West I have made more use of Whewell, and have
borrowed biographical material for the English writers from the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. I have also consulted a good
many of the original astronomical books referred to in the latter
part of the chapter.</p>

<p>I know of no accessible book in English to which to refer
students except <i>Whewell</i>.</p>


<p><i>Chapter IV.</i>—For biographical material, for information as to
the minor writings, and as to the history of the publication of
the <i>De Revolutionibus</i> I have used little but Prowe’s elaborate
<i>Nicolaus Coppernicus</i>, and the documents printed in it. My
account of the <i>De Revolutionibus</i> is taken from the book itself.
The portrait is taken from Dandeleau’s engraving of a picture in
Lalande’s possession. I have not been able to discover any
portrait which was clearly made during Coppernicus’s lifetime,
but the close resemblance between several portraits dating from
the 17th century and Dandeleau’s seems to shew that the latter
is substantially authentic.</p>

<p>There is a readable account of Coppernicus, as well as of several
other astronomers, in Bertrand’s <i>Fondateurs de l’Astronomie
Moderne</i>; but I have not used the book as an authority.</p>


<p><i>Chapter V.</i>—For the life of Tycho I have relied chiefly on
Dreyer’s <i>Tycho Brahe</i>, which has also been used as a guide to
his scientific work; but I have made constant reference to the
original writings: I have also made some use of Gassendi’s <i>Vita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
Tychonis Brahe</i>. The portrait is a reproduction of a picture in
the possession of Dr. Crompton of Manchester, described by him
in the <i>Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical
Society</i>, Vol. VI., Ser. III. For minor Continental writers I have
used chiefly <i>Wolf</i> and <i>Delambre</i>, and for English writers,
<i>Whewell</i>, various articles by De Morgan quoted by him, and
articles in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>.</p>

<p>Students will find in Dreyer’s book all that they are likely to
want to know about Tycho.</p>


<p><i>Chapter VI.</i>—For Galilei’s life I have used chiefly Karl von
Gebler’s <i>Galilei und die Römische Curie</i>, partly in the original
German form and partly in the later English edition (translated
by Mrs. Sturge). For the disputed questions connected with the
trial I have relied as far as possible on the original documents
preserved in the Vatican, which have been published by von
Gebler and independently by L’Épinois in <i>Les Pièces du Procès
de Galilée</i>: in the latter book some of the most important documents
are reproduced in facsimile. For personal characteristics
I have used the charming <i>Private Life of Galileo, compiled
chiefly from his correspondence and that of his daughter Marie
Céleste</i>. I have also read with great interest the estimate of
Galilei’s work contained in H. Martin’s <i>Galilée</i>, and have probably
borrowed from it to some extent. What I have said about
Galilei’s scientific work has been based almost entirely on study
of his own books, either in the original or in translation: I have
used freely the translations of the <i>Dialogue on the Two Chief
Systems of the World</i> and of the <i>Letter to the Grand Duchess
Christine</i> by Salusbury, that of the <i>Two New Sciences</i> by
Weston (as well as that by Salusbury), and that of the <i>Sidereal
Messenger</i> by Carlos. I have also made some use of various
controversial tracts written by enemies of Galilei, which are to be
found (together with his comments on them) in the magnificent
national edition of his works now in course of publication; and
of the critical account of Galilei’s contributions to dynamics
contained in Mach’s <i>Geschichte der Mechanik</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i> and <i>Delambre</i> have only been used to a very small
extent in this chapter, chiefly for the minor writers who are
referred to.</p>

<p>The portrait is a reproduction of one by Sustermans in the
Uffizi Gallery.</p>

<p>There is an excellent popular account of Galilei’s life and
work in the <i>Lives of Eminent Persons</i> published by the Society
for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; students who want
fuller accounts of Galilei’s life should read Gebler’s book and
the <i>Private Life</i>, which have been already quoted, and are
strongly recommended to read at any rate parts of the <i>Dialogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
on the Two Chief Systems of the World</i>, either in the original or
in the picturesque old translation by Salusbury: there is also a
modern German version of this book, as well as of the <i>Two New
Sciences</i>, in Ostwald’s series of <i>Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften</i>.</p>


<p><i>Chapter VII.</i>—For Kepler’s life I have used chiefly <i>Wolf</i>
and the life—or rather biographical material—given by Frisch
in the last volume of his edition of Kepler’s works, also to a
small extent Breitschwerdt’s <i>Johann Keppler</i>. For Kepler’s
scientific discoveries I have used chiefly his own writings, but I
am indebted to some extent to <i>Wolf</i> and <i>Delambre</i>, especially
for information with regard to his minor works. The portrait
is a reproduction of one by Nordling given in Frisch’s edition.</p>

<p>The <i>Lives of Eminent Persons</i>, already referred to, also contains
an excellent popular account of Kepler’s life and work.</p>


<p><i>Chapter VIII.</i>—I have used chiefly <i>Wolf</i> and <i>Delambre</i>;
for the English writers Gascoigne and Horrocks I have used
<i>Whewell</i> and articles in the <i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i> What I have
said about the work of Huygens is taken directly from the books
of his which are quoted in the text; and for special points I
have consulted the <i>Principia</i> of Descartes, and a very few of
Cassini’s extensive writings.</p>

<p>There is no obvious book to recommend to students.</p>


<p><i>Chapter IX.</i>—For the external events of Newton’s life I have
relied chiefly on Brewster’s <i>Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton</i>; and
for the history of the growth of his ideas on the subject of
gravitation I have made extensive use of W. W. R. Ball’s <i>Essay
on Newton’s Principia</i>, and of the original documents contained
in it. I have also made some use of the articles on Newton in
the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> and the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>; as well as of Rigaud’s <i>Correspondence of Scientific
Men of the Seventeenth Century</i>, of Edleston’s <i>Correspondence
of Sir Isaac Newton and Prof. Cotes</i>, and of Baily’s <i>Account of
the Rev<sup>d.</sup> John Flamsteed</i>. The portrait is a reproduction of one
by Kneller.</p>

<p>Students are recommended to read Brewster’s book, quoted
above, or the abridged <i>Life of Sir Isaac Newton</i> by the same
author. The Laws of Motion are discussed in most modern
textbooks of dynamics; the best treatment that I am acquainted
with of the various difficulties connected with them is in an
article by W. H. Macaulay in the <i>Bulletin of the American
Mathematical Society</i>, Ser. II., Vol. III., No. 10, July 1897.</p>


<p><i>Chapter X.</i>—For Flamsteed I have used chiefly Baily’s
<i>Account of the Rev<sup>d.</sup> John Flamsteed</i>; for Bradley little but the
<i>Miscellaneous Works and Correspondence of the Rev. James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
Bradley</i> (edited by Rigaud), from which the portrait has been
taken. My account of Halley’s work is based to a considerable
extent on his own writings; there is a good deal of biographical
information about him in the books already quoted in connection
with Newton and Flamsteed, and there is a useful article on
him in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. I have made
a good deal of use in this chapter of <i>Wolf</i> and <i>Delambre</i>,
especially in dealing with Continental astronomers; and for
special parts of the subject I have used Grant’s <i>History of
Physical Astronomy</i>, Todhunter’s <i>History of the Mathematical
Theories of Attraction and the Figure of the Earth</i>, and
Poynting’s <i>Density of the Earth</i>.</p>


<p><i>Chapter XI.</i>—Most of the biographical material has been
taken from <i>Wolf</i> from articles in various encyclopaedias and
biographical dictionaries, chiefly French, and from Delambre’s
<i>Eloge</i> of Lagrange. The two portraits are taken respectively
from Serret’s edition of the <i>Oeuvres de Lagrange</i> and from
the Academy’s edition of the <i>Oeuvres Complètes de Laplace</i>.
Gautier’s <i>Essai Historique sur le Problème des Trois Corps</i> and
Grant’s <i>History of Physical Astronomy</i> have been the books most
used for my account of the scientific contributions of the various
astronomers dealt with; I have also consulted various modern
treatises on gravitational astronomy, especially Tisserand’s
<i>Mécanique Céleste</i>, Brown’s <i>Lunar Theory</i>, and to a less extent
Cheyne’s <i>Planetary Theory</i> and Airy’s <i>Gravitation</i>. For special
points I have used Todhunter’s <i>History</i>, already referred to.
Of the original writings I have made a good deal of use of
Laplace’s <i>Mécanique Céleste</i> as well as of his <i>Système du Monde</i>;
I have also consulted a certain number of his other writings and
of those of Lagrange and Clairaut; but have made no systematic
study of them.</p>

<p>Students who wish to know more about gravitational astronomy
but have little knowledge of mathematics should try to read
Airy’s <i>Gravitation</i>; Herschel’s <i>Outlines of Astronomy</i> and
Grant’s <i>History</i> (quoted above) also deal with the subject
without employing mathematics, and are tolerably intelligible.</p>


<p><i>Chapter XII.</i>—The account of Herschel’s career is taken
chiefly from Mrs. John Herschel’s <i>Memoir of Caroline Herschel</i>,
from Miss A. M. Clerke’s <i>The Herschels and Modern Astronomy</i>,
from the <i>Popular History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth
Century</i> by the same author, and from Holden’s <i>Sir William
Herschel, his Life and Works</i>. The last three books and the
<i>Synopsis and Subject Index to the Writings of Sir William
Herschel</i> by Holden &amp; Hastings have been my chief guides to
Herschel’s long series of papers; but nearly every thing that I
have said about his chief pieces of work is based on his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
writings. I have made also some little use of Grant’s <i>History</i>
(already quoted), of <i>Wolf</i>, and of Miss Clerke’s <i>System of the
Stars</i>.</p>

<p>Students are recommended to read any or all of the first four
books named above; the <i>Memoir</i> gives a charming picture of
Herschel’s personal life and especially of his relations with his
sister. There is also a good critical account of Herschel’s work
on sidereal astronomy in Proctor’s <i>Old and New Astronomy</i>.</p>


<p><i>Chapter XIII.</i>—Except in the articles dealing with gravitational
astronomy I have constantly used Miss Clerke’s <i>History</i>
(already quoted), a book which students are strongly recommended
to read; and in dealing with the first half of the century
I have been helped a good deal by Grant’s <i>History</i>. But for
the most part the materials for the chapter have been drawn
from a great number of sources—consisting very largely of the
original writings of the astronomers referred to—which it would
be difficult and hardly worth while to enumerate; for the lives
of astronomers (especially of English ones), as well as for recent
astronomical history generally, I have been much helped by the
obituary notices and the reports on the progress of astronomy
which appear annually in the <i>Monthly Notices</i> of the Royal
Astronomical Society.</p>

of modern astronomy in a non-technical way:—</p>

Owing to the greater brightness of the stars overhead they
usually seem a little nearer than those near the horizon, and consequently
the visible portion of the celestial sphere appears to be
rather less than a half of a complete sphere. This is, however, of no
importance, and will for the future be ignored.</p></div>

A right angle is divided into ninety degrees (90°), a degree into
sixty minutes (60′), and a minute into sixty seconds (60″).</p></div>

I have made no attempt either here or elsewhere to describe the
constellations and their positions, as I believe such verbal descriptions
to be almost useless. For a beginner who wishes to become
familiar with them the best plan is to get some better informed,
friend to point out a few of the more conspicuous ones, in different
parts of the sky. Others can then be readily added by means of a
star-atlas, or of the star-maps given in many textbooks.</p></div>

The process may be worth illustrating by means of a simpler
problem. A heavy body, falling freely under gravity, is found (the
resistance of the air being allowed for) to fall about 16 feet in
1 second, 64 feet in 2 seconds, 144 feet in 3 seconds, 256 feet in
4 seconds, 400 feet in 5 seconds, and so on. This series of figures
carried on as far as may be required would satisfy practical requirements,
supplemented if desired by the corresponding figures
for fractions of seconds; but the mathematician represents the same
facts more simply and in a way more satisfactory to the mind by the
formula <i>s</i> = 16 <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>, where <i>s</i> denotes the number of feet fallen, and
<i>t</i> the number of seconds. By giving <i>t</i> any assigned value, the
corresponding space fallen through is at once obtained. Similarly
the motion of the sun can be represented approximately by the
more complicated formula <i>l</i> = <i>nt</i> + 2 <i>e</i> <i>sin</i> <i>nt</i>, where <i>l</i> is the
distance from a fixed point in the orbit, <i>t</i> the time, and <i>n</i>, <i>e</i> certain
numerical quantities.</p></div>

of abstract conclusions, the applicability of which to real life has
to be considered in individual cases. But the perfunctory discussion

The equation of the centre and the evection may be expressed
trigonometrically by two terms in the expression for the moon’s
longitude, <i>a sin</i>θ + <i>b sin</i> (2φ-θ), where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> are two numerical
quantities, in round numbers 6° and 1°, θ is the angular distance of
the moon from perigee, and φ is the angular distance from the sun.
At conjunction and opposition φ is 0° or 180°, and the two terms
reduce to (<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>) <i>sin</i>θ. This would be the form in which the
equation of the centre would have presented itself to Hipparchus.
Ptolemy’s correction is therefore equivalent to adding on</p>
<p class="center">
<i>b</i> [<i>sin</i>θ + <i>sin</i>(2φ - θ)], or 2 <i>b sin</i>φ <i>cos</i> (φ-θ),
</p>

<p class="nindent">
which vanishes at conjunction or opposition, but reduces at the
quadratures to 2 <i>b sin</i>θ, which again vanishes if the moon is at apogee
or perigee (θ = 0° or 180°), but has its greatest value half-way
between, when θ = 90°. Ptolemy’s construction gave rise also to
a still smaller term of the type,</p>

<p class="center">
<i>c sin</i> 2φ [<i>cos</i> (2φ + θ) + 2 <i>cos</i> (2φ - θ)],</p>

conjunction and opposition.</p></div>

The advantage derived from the use of the equant can be made
clearer by a mathematical comparison with the elliptic motion introduced
by Kepler. In elliptic motion the angular motion and
distance are represented approximately by the formulae <i>nt</i> + 2<i>e sin nt</i>,
<i>a</i> (1 - <i>e cos nt</i>) respectively; the corresponding formulæ given by
the use of the simple eccentric are <i>nt + e′ sin nt</i>, <i>a</i> (1 - <i>e′ cos nt</i>).
To make the angular motions agree we must therefore take <i>e′</i> = 2<i>e</i>,
but to make the distances agree we must take <i>e′ = e</i>; the two conditions
are therefore inconsistent. But by the introduction of an
equant the formulæ become <i>nt</i> + 2<i>e′ sin nt</i>, <i>a</i> (1 - <i>e′ cos nt</i>), and
<i>both</i> agree if we take <i>e′ = e</i>. Ptolemy’s lunar theory could have
been nearly freed from the serious difficulty already noticed (<a href="#para_48">§&nbsp;48</a>)
if he had used an equant to represent the chief inequality of the
moon; and his planetary theory would have been made accurate
to the first order of small quantities by the use of an equant both
for the deferent and the epicycle.</p></div>

To Coppernicus, as to many of his contemporaries, as well as to
the Greeks, the simplest form of a revolution of one body round
another was a motion in which the revolving body moved as if
rigidly attached to the central body. Thus in the case of the earth
the second motion was such that the axis of the earth remained
inclined at a constant angle to the line joining earth and sun, and
therefore changed its direction in space. In order then to make the
axis retain a (nearly) fixed direction in space, it was necessary to add
a <i>third</i> motion.</p></div>

modern observations make this fraction about 1∕13. Or, to put it otherwise,
the diameter of the moon when greatest ought to exceed its
value when least by about 8′ according to Coppernicus, and by about 5′
according to modern observations.</p></div>

It is commonly stated that Newton’s value of the motion of the
moon’s apses was only about half the true value. In a scholium
of the <i>Principia</i> to prop. 35 of the third book, given in the first
edition but afterwards omitted, he estimated the annual motion at
40°, the observed value being about 41°. In one of his unpublished
papers, contained in the Portsmouth collection, he arrived at 39° by
a process which he evidently regarded as not altogether satisfactory.</p></div>

Throughout the Coppernican controversy up to Newton’s time
it had been generally assumed, both by Coppernicans and by their
opponents, that there was some meaning in speaking of a body simply
as being “at rest” or “in motion,” without any reference to any
other body. But all that we can really observe is the motion of one
body relative to one or more others. Astronomical observation tells
us, for example, of a certain motion relative to one another of the
earth and sun; and this motion was expressed in two quite different
ways by Ptolemy and by Coppernicus. From a modern standpoint
the question ultimately involved was whether the motions of the
various bodies of the solar system relatively to the earth or relatively
to the sun were the simpler to express. If it is found convenient to
express them—as Coppernicus and Galilei did—in relation to the
sun, some simplicity of statement is gained by speaking of the sun
as “fixed” and omitting the qualification “relative to the sun” in
speaking of any other body. The same motions might have been
expressed relatively to any other body chosen at will: <i>e.g.</i> to one of
the hands of a watch carried by a man walking up and down on the
deck of a ship on a rough sea; in this case it is clear that the motions
of the other bodies of the solar system relative to this body would be
excessively complicated; and it would therefore be highly inconvenient
though still possible to treat this particular body as “fixed.”</p>

<p>A new aspect of the problem presents itself, however, when an
attempt—like Newton’s—is made to explain the motions of bodies of
the solar system as the result of forces exerted on one another by
those bodies. If, for example, we look at Newton’s First Law of
Motion (chapter <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, <a href="#para_130">§&nbsp;130</a>), we see that it has no meaning, unless we
know what are the body or bodies relative to which the motion is
being expressed; a body at rest relatively to the earth is moving
relatively to the sun or to the fixed stars, and the applicability of the
First Law to it depends therefore on whether we are dealing with its
motion relatively to the earth or not. For most terrestrial motions
it is sufficient to regard the Laws of Motion as referring to motion
relative to the earth; or, in other words, we may for this purpose
treat the earth as “fixed.” But if we examine certain terrestrial
motions more exactly, we find that the Laws of Motion thus interpreted
are not quite true; but that we get a more accurate explanation of
the observed phenomena if we regard the Laws of Motion as referring
to motion relative to the centre of the sun and to lines drawn from it
to the stars; or, in other words, we treat the centre of the sun as a
“fixed” point and these lines as “fixed” directions. But again when
we are dealing with the solar system generally this interpretation is
slightly inaccurate, and we have to treat the centre of gravity of the
solar system instead of the sun as “fixed.”</p>

<p>From this point of view we may say that Newton’s object in the
<i>Principia</i> was to shew that it was possible to choose a certain point
(the centre of gravity of the solar system) and certain directions
(lines joining this point to the fixed stars), as a base of reference,
such that all motions being treated as relative to this base, the Laws
of Motion and the law of gravitation afford a consistent explanation
of the observed motions of the bodies of the solar system.</p></div>

He estimated the annual precession due to the sun to be about
9″, and that due to the moon to be about four and a half times as
great, so that the total amount due to the two bodies came out about
50″, which agrees within a fraction of a second with the amount
shewn by observation; but we know now that the moon’s share is
not much more than twice that of the sun.</p></div>

Nearly the whole of the “eccentricity fund” and of the
“inclination fund” of the solar system is shared between Jupiter

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
